{'suggestion': 'To optimize performance for partitioned tables in PostgreSQL, enable partition pruning by setting the `enable_partition_pruning` knob to `on`. This can be done by modifying the configuration file (postgresql.conf) or using the SQL command `SET enable_partition_pruning = ON;` in a session. This setting allows the query planner to eliminate unnecessary partitions from query plans and enables the query executor to ignore these partitions during execution.'}
