{'suggestion': "The 'enable_nestloop' knob in PostgreSQL, which is enabled by default, controls the query planner's preference for nested-loop join plans. You can adjust its value using the command `SET enable_nestloop TO 'on'` to enable nested loop joins or `SET enable_nestloop TO 'off'` to disable them, allowing you to discourage their use in favor of alternative join methods without completely eliminating them."}
