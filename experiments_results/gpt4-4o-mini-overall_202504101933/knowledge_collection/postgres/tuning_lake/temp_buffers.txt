{'suggestion': "To optimize the `temp_buffers` setting in PostgreSQL, configure its value to 16MB for standard usage, with the option to increase it to 32MB or more based on the workload's temporary table usage. Remember that the 'temp_buffers' knob sets the maximum memory allocated for temporary buffers per database session, with a default of 8MB, and can only be adjusted before using temporary tables."}
