{'suggestion': "The `default_statistics_target` in PostgreSQL is a crucial setting that determines the default statistics target for table columns that do not have a specific target assigned. It influences the time required for the ANALYZE command and can enhance the accuracy of the planner's estimates. It is generally recommended to set this value between 100 to 300, with a starting point of 250 for complex queries or when dealing with large datasets, as larger values can increase the ANALYZE time."}
