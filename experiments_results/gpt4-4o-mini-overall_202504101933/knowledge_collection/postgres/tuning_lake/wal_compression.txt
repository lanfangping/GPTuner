{'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL's performance for larger transaction logs, enable the 'wal_compression' parameter by setting it to 'on'. This feature compresses full page images written to the Write Ahead Log (WAL) when 'full_page_writes' is active, which can significantly reduce WAL volume without increasing the risk of unrecoverable data corruption. However, be aware that this may lead to higher CPU usage during both logging and replay. Note that modifying this parameter requires superuser privileges."}
