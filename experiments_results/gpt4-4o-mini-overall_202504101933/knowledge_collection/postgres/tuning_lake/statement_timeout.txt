{'suggestion': "To set the `statement_timeout` in PostgreSQL, which aborts any statement that exceeds a specified execution time limit, use the command `SET statement_timeout = '5000ms';` to limit queries to 5 seconds, or adjust the duration by replacing `5000ms` with your desired time (e.g., `600000ms` for a 10-minute timeout). Additionally, ensure that the 'log_min_error_statement' is set to ERROR or lower to log any timed-out statements."}
