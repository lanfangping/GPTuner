{'suggestion': "To optimize the `maintenance_work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to a value between 10-15% of the total system memory, generally ranging from 65536 kB to 1048576 kB, depending on your system's available RAM and workload requirements. This parameter, which defaults to 64 MB, is crucial for maintenance tasks like VACUUM and CREATE INDEX, and should be adjusted higher for improved performance while considering that autovacuum may allocate up to 'autovacuum_max_workers' times this memory."}
