{'suggestion': "To effectively manage the autovacuum feature in PostgreSQL, ensure that the 'autovacuum' knob is set to 'on' in the postgresql.conf file or via command line, as it controls the autovacuum launcher daemon. Additionally, make sure 'track_counts' is enabled for optimal functioning. Note that even if autovacuum is disabled, processes will still initiate to prevent transaction ID wraparound."}
