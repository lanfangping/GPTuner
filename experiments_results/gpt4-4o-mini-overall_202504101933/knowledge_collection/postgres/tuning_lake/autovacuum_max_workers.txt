{'suggestion': "Set the 'autovacuum_max_workers' parameter in PostgreSQL to a maximum of three autovacuum processes (excluding the autovacuum launcher) to run concurrently. For small to medium databases, begin with this value, and for larger databases, consider increasing it to between 6 to 10 workers, adjusting as necessary based on performance needs."}
