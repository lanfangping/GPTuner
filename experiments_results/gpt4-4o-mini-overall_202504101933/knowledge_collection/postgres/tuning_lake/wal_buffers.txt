{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'wal_buffers' parameter in PostgreSQL, manually configure it to a practical starting point of 16MB for systems with moderate write loads, and consider increasing it to 32MB or higher based on the volume of write operations. Ensure that the value does not exceed 25% of 'shared_buffers' for optimal performance, as this setting significantly impacts write performance, especially on busy servers."}
