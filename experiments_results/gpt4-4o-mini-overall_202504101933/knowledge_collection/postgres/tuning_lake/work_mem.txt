{'suggestion': "To effectively configure the 'work_mem' parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to 1024-2048 kB for light workloads and increase it to 4096-16384 kB for more demanding queries. This parameter defines the maximum memory limit for operations such as sorting and hash tables, but be aware that complex queries may consume more memory concurrently, particularly during hash operations. Ensure that the total memory usage does not exceed your system's available RAM to prevent swapping. For instance, setting 'work_mem' to 16384 kB is appropriate for systems managing moderate workloads with up to 100 concurrent connections, leading to a maximum usage of 1.6 GB."}
