{'suggestion': "Configure the `wal_keep_size` parameter in PostgreSQL to specify the amount of past Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) file segments to retain in the pg_wal directory for standby servers, measured in megabytes. The default value is zero, indicating that no extra segments are kept unless specified. Set this parameter to a value typically between 64MB and 512MB, based on your system's workload and replication needs."}
