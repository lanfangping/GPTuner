{'suggestion': "To optimize performance for large queries in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to set the 'enable_partitionwise_join' setting to 'on' to allow for more efficient joins between partitioned tables, particularly when join conditions include all partition keys. However, be cautious as this can lead to increased memory usage proportional to the number of partitions scanned, potentially resulting in higher CPU and memory costs during query planning and execution."}
