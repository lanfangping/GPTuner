{'suggestion': "To optimize query performance in PostgreSQL by enabling index-only scans, ensure that the 'enable_indexonlyscan' setting is set to 'on'. This can be done by executing `SET enable_indexonlyscan = on;` or by adding `enable_indexonlyscan = on` to your postgresql.conf file. Note that this setting is enabled by default and requires the 'enable_indexscan' setting to also be active for it to be considered by the query planner."}
