{'suggestion': 'For the PostgreSQL parameter `bgwriter_flush_after`, it is recommended to configure it to 128 to optimize background writer performance, especially in workloads with frequent writes. This setting helps reduce transaction latency by forcing OS writebacks when more than 512kB of data has been written by the background writer, but it should be set with consideration of the available memory limits for your system to avoid potential performance degradation.'}
