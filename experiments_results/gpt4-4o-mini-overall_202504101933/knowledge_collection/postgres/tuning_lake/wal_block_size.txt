{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `wal_block_size` in PostgreSQL, it is important to understand that this setting reports the size of a WAL disk block, which is based on the XLOG_BLCKSZ configuration used during server build. For general workloads, set the `wal_block_size` to its default value, but consider increasing it for systems with large transaction sizes or high write loads. Ensure that the setting aligns with the filesystem block size and the memory capabilities of your database server.'}
