{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'full_page_writes' parameter in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to keep it enabled by default to ensure that the entire content of modified disk pages is written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) after a checkpoint, which helps prevent potential data corruption during crashes. However, in environments where write operations are infrequent and the risk of data loss is acceptable, you may consider setting it to 'off' to enhance performance, keeping in mind that this could lead to unrecoverable corruption similar to disabling fsync."}
