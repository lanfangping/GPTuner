{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'track_activities' knob in PostgreSQL, ensure it is set to 'on' to enable tracking of the current activity of sessions, which is particularly beneficial for diagnosing performance issues in environments with multiple concurrent connections or performance bottlenecks. This feature, which is enabled by default, allows superusers and certain privileged roles to collect information on the currently executing command for each session along with the start time, while ensuring that this sensitive information remains hidden from non-privileged users to minimize security risks."}
