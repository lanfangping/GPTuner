{'suggestion': "To configure the `pg_stat_statements.track` setting in PostgreSQL, you can set its value to `none`, `top`, or `all`, depending on your tracking needs. The recommended setting is `all`, which captures statistics for all queries. This configuration can be made in the `postgresql.conf` file or by executing the SQL command `ALTER SYSTEM SET pg_stat_statements.track = 'all';`. After making this change, you will need to restart the PostgreSQL service or run `SELECT pg_reload_conf();` to apply the new settings."}
