{'suggestion': "To configure the 'wal_level' parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to 'replica' for most production environments as it supports replication and archiving. Alternatively, use 'minimal' for basic logging to enhance performance with limited crash recovery capabilities, or 'logical' for scenarios requiring logical replication, which generates a higher volume of Write-Ahead Log data by logging full row information for updates and deletions. Each level encompasses the functionalities of the lower tiers."}
