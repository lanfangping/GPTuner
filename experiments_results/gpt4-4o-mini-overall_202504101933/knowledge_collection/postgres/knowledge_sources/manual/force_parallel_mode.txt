The 'force_parallel_mode' knob allows for three settings: 'off' (default, using parallel mode only for performance improvement), 'on' (enforcing parallel query execution with added Gather nodes, which may cause prohibitions on certain operations), and 'regress' (similar to 'on' but modifies output for regression testing by hiding context lines from parallel workers and Gather nodes in EXPLAIN).
