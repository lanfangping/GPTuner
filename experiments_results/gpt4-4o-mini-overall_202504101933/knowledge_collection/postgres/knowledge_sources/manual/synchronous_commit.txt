The 'synchronous_commit' knob controls the level of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) processing before a success indication is returned to the client, with options including 'off' (no waiting, leading to potential delays up to three times the wal_writer_delay), 'local' (wait for WAL flush to disk), 'on' (default, wait for flush to durable storage on standbys), 'remote_write' (wait for reception and writing on standbys), and 'remote_apply' (wait for receipt and application on standbys), allowing flexibility in balancing performance and data durability.
