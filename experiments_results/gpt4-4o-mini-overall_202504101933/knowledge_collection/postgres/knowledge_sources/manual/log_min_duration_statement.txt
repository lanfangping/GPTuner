The 'log_min_duration_statement' setting logs the duration of completed SQL statements that run for at least the specified time (in milliseconds), with a default of -1 to disable logging, while setting it to zero logs all statement durations; for instance, setting it to 250ms will log all statements that take 250ms or longer, aiding in the identification of unoptimized queries.
