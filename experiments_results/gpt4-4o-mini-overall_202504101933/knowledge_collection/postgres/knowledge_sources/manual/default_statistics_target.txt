The 'default_statistics_target' knob in PostgreSQL, which is set to a default value of 100, determines the default statistics target for table columns lacking a specific target, influencing the time required for ANALYZE and potentially enhancing the accuracy of the planner's estimates, with larger values increasing ANALYZE time.
