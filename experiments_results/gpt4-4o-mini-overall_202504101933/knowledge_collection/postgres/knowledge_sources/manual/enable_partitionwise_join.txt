The 'enable_partitionwise_join' setting, which is off by default, allows for more efficient joins between partitioned tables by joining matching partitions when join conditions include all partition keys, but can lead to increased memory usage linearly proportional to the number of partitions scanned, resulting in significantly higher CPU and memory costs during query planning and execution.
