To optimize the `enable_mergejoin` setting in PostgreSQL, it is generally recommended to set its value to `on` (1) to allow the use of merge joins under normal circumstances, while setting it to `off` (0) in specific queries where you want to avoid merge join usage, particularly in cases with small result sets or when there's a presumed performance issue identified through query planning.
