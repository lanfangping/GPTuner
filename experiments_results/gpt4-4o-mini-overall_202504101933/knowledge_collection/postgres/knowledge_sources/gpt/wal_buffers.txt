To set the 'wal_buffers' parameter in PostgreSQL, a practical starting point is to configure it to 16MB for systems with moderate write loads, and consider increasing it to 32MB or higher based on the volume of write operations, ensuring it does not exceed 25% of shared_buffers for optimal performance.
