To set the value of the 'track_counts' knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (set it to 'on'), as this allows the system to collect statistics for active database objects, which can be particularly useful for performance tuning; typically, this is left at its default of 'on' unless there is a specific reason to disable tracking.
