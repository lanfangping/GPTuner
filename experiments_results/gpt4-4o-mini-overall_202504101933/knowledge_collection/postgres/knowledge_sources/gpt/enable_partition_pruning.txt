To enable partition pruning in PostgreSQL, set the knob `enable_partition_pruning` to `on` (which is the default value) by modifying the configuration file (postgresql.conf) or using the SQL command `SET enable_partition_pruning = ON;` in a session, as this allows the query planner to optimize partitioned table queries by eliminating unnecessary partitions based on the query's WHERE clause.
