To set the `statement_timeout` in PostgreSQL, which specifies the maximum allowed execution time for a query, you can use the command `SET statement_timeout = '5s';` to limit queries to 5 seconds, or adjust it to a different duration by replacing `5s` with your desired time (e.g., `10min` for a 10-minute timeout).
