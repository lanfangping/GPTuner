The `checkpoint_flush_after` setting in PostgreSQL, which controls the minimum amount of data that must be flushed to disk after a checkpoint before allowing any further writes to that area, can be set to a value between 64 KB and 1 GB, with a common recommendation being to start with a value of around 256 MB for systems with high write workloads, while monitoring system performance to adjust as necessary.
