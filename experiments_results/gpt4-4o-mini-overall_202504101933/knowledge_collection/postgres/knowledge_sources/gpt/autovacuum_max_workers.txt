To set the 'autovacuum_max_workers' parameter in PostgreSQL, you generally want to begin with a value of 3 to 5 workers for small to medium databases, and for larger databases, consider increasing the value to 6 to 10 workers, ensuring that the total does not exceed the number of available CPU cores.
