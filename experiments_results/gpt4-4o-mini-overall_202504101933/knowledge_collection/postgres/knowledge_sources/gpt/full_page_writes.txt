To set the 'full_page_writes' parameter in PostgreSQL, adjust its value in the configuration file (postgresql.conf) to 'on' for systems with a high frequency of writes, especially on large transactions (recommended to keep it enabled, typically set to 'on' if your database is 512MB or larger), or set it to 'off' for environments where write operations are rare and data loss on crash is acceptable.
