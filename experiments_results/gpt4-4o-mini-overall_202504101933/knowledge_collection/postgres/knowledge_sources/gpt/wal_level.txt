To set the 'wal_level' parameter in PostgreSQL, choose between the values 'minimal' for basic replication and point-in-time recovery, 'replica' for supporting physical replication and logical decoding (recommended for most setups), or 'logical' to enable logical replication, with 'replica' being the default setting that suits most production environments.
