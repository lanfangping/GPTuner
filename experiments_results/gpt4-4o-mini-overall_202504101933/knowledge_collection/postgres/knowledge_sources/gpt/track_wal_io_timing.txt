For the `track_wal_io_timing` parameter in PostgreSQL, set its value to `on` to enable tracking of WAL (Write-Ahead Log) I/O timing, which can help analyze performance; this is particularly useful when diagnosing I/O-related issues in high-load scenarios, but should be used judiciously in production due to the potential overhead it introduces.
