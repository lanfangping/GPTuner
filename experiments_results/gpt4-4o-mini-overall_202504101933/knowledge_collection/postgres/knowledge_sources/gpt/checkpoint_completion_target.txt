To set the `checkpoint_completion_target` in PostgreSQL, configure it to a value between 0.0 and 1.0, with a common recommendation of around 0.5, which serves as a target for how much of the checkpoint interval should be spent completing the checkpoint process to minimize performance impact during write-heavy workloads.
