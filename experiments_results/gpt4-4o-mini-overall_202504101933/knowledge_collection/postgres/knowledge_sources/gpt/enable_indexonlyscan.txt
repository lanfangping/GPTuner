To enable the `enable_indexonlyscan` setting in PostgreSQL for optimizing query performance, you should set its value to `on` by executing `SET enable_indexonlyscan = on;`, or you can add `enable_indexonlyscan = on` to your postgresql.conf file, allowing index-only scans when at least one heap tuple is visible to the query, and statistics show a significant benefit, typically measured against the size and number of rows involved in common queries.
