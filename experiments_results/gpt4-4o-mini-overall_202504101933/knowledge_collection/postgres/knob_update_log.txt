max_connections
TUNING_SUGGESTION:
{'suggestion': "To configure the 'max_connections' parameter in PostgreSQL, start by understanding that this setting regulates the maximum number of concurrent connections to the database server, typically defaulting to 100. However, it may need to be adjusted lower based on kernel settings or higher based on workload demands. A common formula for determining the optimal value is `max_connections = (number of CPU cores) x (max simultaneous connections per core)`, which may range from 100 for light workloads to 200 for heavier workloads. Ensure that the total memory usage does not exceed the available system RAM, with an estimate of 1-2 MB per connection. Note that this parameter must be configured at server startup, and standby servers should have the same or a higher value than the master server."}

I first give you a knob of postgres, determine if it is related to resources, focusing primarily on CPU, RAM, disk size, and disk type. Note that some knobs may not appear directly related to resources but are indeed associated with them, so please exercise careful discernment. 

let's think step by step

step 1: Summarize the function of  knob from postgres  with no more than five sentences.
step 2: Judge whether this knob is related to cpu, ram, disk type or disk size.
step 3: If the knob is related to any hardware resource in step 2, return the boolean value true, otherwise, return the boolean value false.

Please give me the result in json format.
