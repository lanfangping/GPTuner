                DESCRIPTION:
                Determines the maximum number of concurrent connections to the database server. The default is typically 100 connections, but might be less if your kernel settings will not support it (as determined during initdb). This parameter can only be set at server start.
When running a standby server, you must set this parameter to the same or higher value than on the master server. Otherwise, queries will not be allowed in the standby server.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the 'max_connections' parameter in PostgreSQL, start by determining the optimal value based on the expected workload, typically using a formula of `max_connections = (number of CPU cores) x (max simultaneous connections per core),` commonly set around 100 for light workloads, increasing to 200-300 for heavier workloads, while ensuring that the total memory usage does not exceed the available system RAM (e.g., 1-2 MB per connection).

Summerize the description for knob 'enable_partitionwise_aggregate' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Enables or disables the query planner's use of partitionwise grouping or aggregation, which allows grouping or aggregation on partitioned tables to be performed separately for each partition. If the GROUP BY clause does not include the partition keys, only partial aggregation can be performed on a per-partition basis, and finalization must be performed later. With this setting enabled, the number of nodes whose memory usage is restricted by work_mem appearing in the final plan can increase linearly according to the number of partitions being scanned. This can result in a large increase in overall memory consumption during the execution of the query. Query planning also becomes significantly more expensive in terms of memory and CPU. The default value is off.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value.

DESCRIPTION:
Sets the planner's assumption about the effective size of the disk cache that is available to a single query. This is factored into estimates of the cost of using an index; a higher value makes it more likely index scans will be used, a lower value makes it more likely sequential scans will be used. When setting this parameter you should consider both PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the portion of the kernel's disk cache that will be used for PostgreSQL data files, though some data might exist in both places. Also, take into account the expected number of concurrent queries on different tables, since they will have to share the available space. This parameter has no effect on the size of shared memory allocated by PostgreSQL, nor does it reserve kernel disk cache; it is used only for estimation purposes. The system also does not assume data remains in the disk cache between queries. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. The default is 4 gigabytes (4GB). (If BLCKSZ is not 8kB, the default value scales proportionally to it.)

                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies the maximum amount of memory to be used by maintenance operations, such as VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as kilobytes. It defaults to 64 megabytes (64MB). Since only one of these operations can be executed at a time by a database session, and an installation normally doesn't have many of them running concurrently, it's safe to set this value significantly larger than work_mem. Larger settings might improve performance for vacuuming and for restoring database dumps.
Note that when autovacuum runs, up to autovacuum_max_workers times this memory may be allocated, so be careful not to set the default value too high. It may be useful to control for this by separately setting autovacuum_work_mem.
Note that for the collection of dead tuple identifiers, VACUUM is only able to utilize up to a maximum of 1GB of memory.

Summerize the description for knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Specifies the cost limit value that will be used in automatic VACUUM operations. If -1 is specified (which is the default), the regular vacuum_cost_limit value will be used. Note that the value is distributed proportionally among the running autovacuum workers, if there is more than one, so that the sum of the limits for each worker does not exceed the value of this variable. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies the maximum age (in multixacts) that a table's pg_class.relminmxid field can attain before a VACUUM operation is forced to prevent multixact ID wraparound within the table. Note that the system will launch autovacuum processes to prevent wraparound even when autovacuum is otherwise disabled.
Vacuuming multixacts also allows removal of old files from the pg_multixact/members and pg_multixact/offsets subdirectories, which is why the default is a relatively low 400 million multixacts. This parameter can only be set at server start, but the setting can be reduced for individual tables by changing table storage parameters. For more information see Section 24.1.5.1.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.

                DESCRIPTION:
                This is the amount of time to wait on a lock before checking to see if there is a deadlock condition. The check for deadlock is relatively expensive, so the server doesn't run it every time it waits for a lock. We optimistically assume that deadlocks are not common in production applications and just wait on the lock for a while before checking for a deadlock. Increasing this value reduces the amount of time wasted in needless deadlock checks, but slows down reporting of real deadlock errors. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. The default is one second (1s), which is probably about the smallest value you would want in practice. On a heavily loaded server you might want to raise it. Ideally the setting should exceed your typical transaction time, so as to improve the odds that a lock will be released before the waiter decides to check for deadlock. Only superusers can change this setting.
When log_lock_waits is set, this parameter also determines the amount of time to wait before a log message is issued about the lock wait. If you are trying to investigate locking delays you might want to set a shorter than normal deadlock_timeout.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the maximum amount of memory used for temporary buffers within each database session. These are session-local buffers used only for access to temporary tables. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. The default is eight megabytes (8MB). (If BLCKSZ is not 8kB, the default value scales proportionally to it.) This setting can be changed within individual sessions, but only before the first use of temporary tables within the session; subsequent attempts to change the value will have no effect on that session.
A session will allocate temporary buffers as needed up to the limit given by temp_buffers. The cost of setting a large value in sessions that do not actually need many temporary buffers is only a buffer descriptor, or about 64 bytes, per increment in temp_buffers. However if a buffer is actually used an additional 8192 bytes will be consumed for it (or in general, BLCKSZ bytes).

                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies the maximum age (in transactions) that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can attain before a VACUUM operation is forced to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. Note that the system will launch autovacuum processes to prevent wraparound even when autovacuum is otherwise disabled.
Vacuum also allows removal of old files from the pg_xact subdirectory, which is why the default is a relatively low 200 million transactions. This parameter can only be set at server start, but the setting can be reduced for individual tables by changing table storage parameters. For more information see Section 24.1.5.

                Specifies the minimum size of past log file segments kept in the pg_wal directory, in case a standby server needs to fetch them for streaming replication. If a standby server connected to the sending server falls behind by more than wal_keep_size megabytes, the sending server might remove a WAL segment still needed by the standby, in which case the replication connection will be terminated. Downstream connections will also eventually fail as a result. (However, the standby server can recover by fetching the segment from archive, if WAL archiving is in use.)
This sets only the minimum size of segments retained in pg_wal; the system might need to retain more segments for WAL archival or to recover from a checkpoint. If wal_keep_size is zero (the default), the system doesn't keep any extra segments for standby purposes, so the number of old WAL segments available to standby servers is a function of the location of the previous checkpoint and status of WAL archiving. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as megabytes. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

                Summerize the description for knob 'lock_timeout' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Abort any statement that waits longer than the specified amount of time while attempting to acquire a lock on a table, index, row, or other database object. The time limit applies separately to each lock acquisition attempt. The limit applies both to explicit locking requests (such as LOCK TABLE, or SELECT FOR UPDATE without NOWAIT) and to implicitly-acquired locks. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. A value of zero (the default) disables the timeout.
Unlike statement_timeout, this timeout can only occur while waiting for locks. Note that if statement_timeout is nonzero, it is rather pointless to set lock_timeout to the same or larger value, since the statement timeout would always trigger first. If log_min_error_statement is set to ERROR or lower, the statement that timed out will be logged.
Setting lock_timeout in postgresql.conf is not recommended because it would affect all sessions.

Summerize the description for knob 'track_io_timing' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Enables timing of database I/O calls. This parameter is off by default, because it will repeatedly query the operating system for the current time, which may cause significant overhead on some platforms. You can use the pg_test_timing tool to measure the overhead of timing on your system. I/O timing information is displayed in pg_stat_database, in the output of EXPLAIN when the BUFFERS option is used, and by pg_stat_statements. Only superusers can change this setting.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the base maximum amount of memory to be used by a query operation (such as a sort or hash table) before writing to temporary disk files. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as kilobytes. The default value is four megabytes (4MB). Note that a complex query might perform several sort and hash operations at the same time, with each operation generally being allowed to use as much memory as this value specifies before it starts to write data into temporary files. Also, several running sessions could be doing such operations concurrently. Therefore, the total memory used could be many times the value of work_mem; it is necessary to keep this fact in mind when choosing the value. Sort operations are used for ORDER BY, DISTINCT, and merge joins. Hash tables are used in hash joins, hash-based aggregation, and hash-based processing of IN subqueries.
Hash-based operations are generally more sensitive to memory availability than equivalent sort-based operations. The memory limit for a hash table is computed by multiplying work_mem by hash_mem_multiplier. This makes it possible for hash-based operations to use an amount of memory that exceeds the usual work_mem base amount.

                Summerize the description for knob 'shared_buffers' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers. The default is typically 128 megabytes (128MB), but might be less if your kernel settings will not support it (as determined during initdb). This setting must be at least 128 kilobytes. However, settings significantly higher than the minimum are usually needed for good performance. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. (Non-default values of BLCKSZ change the minimum value.) This parameter can only be set at server start.
If you have a dedicated database server with 1GB or more of RAM, a reasonable starting value for shared_buffers is 25% of the memory in your system. There are some workloads where even larger settings for shared_buffers are effective, but because PostgreSQL also relies on the operating system cache, it is unlikely that an allocation of more than 40% of RAM to shared_buffers will work better than a smaller amount. Larger settings for shared_buffers usually require a corresponding increase in max_wal_size, in order to spread out the process of writing large quantities of new or changed data over a longer period of time.
On systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage of RAM is appropriate, so as to leave adequate space for the operating system.

Do not remove the other information. The priority is defined in sequence as "manual_suggestion, web_suggestion, gpt_suggestion" from higher to lower. So manual_suggestion should not be changed. If there is contradiction within the same suggestion, keep it.  Try to make your summary encapsulates information from the three suggestions as much as possible except from the contradictory parts.    
THREE SUGGESTIONS:
{'gpt_suggestion': "To optimize the 'track_activities' knob in PostgreSQL, set its value to 'on' to enable tracking of the current activity of sessions, especially beneficial when diagnosing performance issues; consider enabling it in environments with multiple concurrent connections or performance bottlenecks.", 'web_suggestion': None, 'manual_suggestion': "The 'track_activities' knob, which is enabled by default, allows superusers and certain privileged roles to collect information on the currently executing command for each session along with the start time of that command, ensuring that this information is not visible to all users, thus minimizing security risks."}

Now let's think step by step, and give me the result in legal json format.:
    {
        "gpt_suggestion": null,  // if the original provided suggestion is empty, return null, else return the corresponding answer.
        "web_suggestion": null,  // if the original provided suggestion is empty, return null, else return the corresponding answer.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

Summerize the description for knob 'checkpoint_flush_after' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Whenever more than this amount of data has been written while performing a checkpoint, attempt to force the OS to issue these writes to the underlying storage. Doing so will limit the amount of dirty data in the kernel's page cache, reducing the likelihood of stalls when an fsync is issued at the end of the checkpoint, or when the OS writes data back in larger batches in the background. Often that will result in greatly reduced transaction latency, but there also are some cases, especially with workloads that are bigger than shared_buffers, but smaller than the OS's page cache, where performance might degrade. This setting may have no effect on some platforms. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. The valid range is between 0, which disables forced writeback, and 2MB. The default is 256kB on Linux, 0 elsewhere. (If BLCKSZ is not 8kB, the default and maximum values scale proportionally to it.) This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".

                Summerize the description for knob 'log_min_duration_statement' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Causes the duration of each completed statement to be logged if the statement ran for at least the specified amount of time. For example, if you set it to 250ms then all SQL statements that run 250ms or longer will be logged. Enabling this parameter can be helpful in tracking down unoptimized queries in your applications. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. Setting this to zero prints all statement durations. -1 (the default) disables logging statement durations. Only superusers can change this setting.
This overrides log_min_duration_sample, meaning that queries with duration exceeding this setting are not subject to sampling and are always logged.
For clients using extended query protocol, durations of the Parse, Bind, and Execute steps are logged independently.
When using this option together with log_statement, the text of statements that are logged because of log_statement will not be repeated in the duration log message. If you are not using syslog, it is recommended that you log the PID or session ID using log_line_prefix so that you can link the statement message to the later duration message using the process ID or session ID.

                DESCRIPTION:
                If this parameter is on, the PostgreSQL server will try to make sure that updates are physically written to disk, by issuing fsync() system calls or various equivalent methods (see wal_sync_method). This ensures that the database cluster can recover to a consistent state after an operating system or hardware crash.
While turning off fsync is often a performance benefit, this can result in unrecoverable data corruption in the event of a power failure or system crash. Thus it is only advisable to turn off fsync if you can easily recreate your entire database from external data.
Examples of safe circumstances for turning off fsync include the initial loading of a new database cluster from a backup file, using a database cluster for processing a batch of data after which the database will be thrown away and recreated, or for a read-only database clone which gets recreated frequently and is not used for failover. High quality hardware alone is not a sufficient justification for turning off fsync.
For reliable recovery when changing fsync off to on, it is necessary to force all modified buffers in the kernel to durable storage. This can be done while the cluster is shutdown or while fsync is on by running initdb --sync-only, running sync, unmounting the file system, or rebooting the server.
In many situations, turning off synchronous_commit for noncritical transactions can provide much of the potential performance benefit of turning off fsync, without the attendant risks of data corruption.
fsync can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. If you turn this parameter off, also consider turning off full_page_writes.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:
 {'boot_val': 'on', 'category': 'Write-Ahead Log / Settings', 'context': 'sighup', 'enumvals': None, 'extra_desc': 'The server will use the fsync() system call in several places to make sure that updates are physically written to disk.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To optimize the 'fsync' setting in PostgreSQL, configure it to 'on' for data integrity, but if you prioritize performance and are willing to risk data loss during a crash, consider setting it to 'off'; for most scenarios, keeping it 'on' is recommended, leveraging disk write caching with a reliable UPS to prevent data loss.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 None

Summerize the description for knob 'max_wal_size' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Maximum size to let the WAL grow during automatic checkpoints. This is a soft limit; WAL size can exceed max_wal_size under special circumstances, such as heavy load, a failing archive_command, or a high wal_keep_size setting. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as megabytes. The default is 1 GB. Increasing this parameter can increase the amount of time needed for crash recovery. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

Whenever more than this amount of data has been written by the background writer, attempt to force the OS to issue these writes to the underlying storage. Doing so will limit the amount of dirty data in the kernel's page cache, reducing the likelihood of stalls when an fsync is issued at the end of a checkpoint, or when the OS writes data back in larger batches in the background. Often that will result in greatly reduced transaction latency, but there also are some cases, especially with workloads that are bigger than shared_buffers, but smaller than the OS's page cache, where performance might degrade. This setting may have no effect on some platforms. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. The valid range is between 0, which disables forced writeback, and 2MB. The default is 512kB on Linux, 0 elsewhere. (If BLCKSZ is not 8kB, the default and maximum values scale proportionally to it.) This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 For the PostgreSQL parameter `bgwriter_flush_after`, it is recommended to set it to a value between 2 MB and 8 MB (e.g., 4 MB) to optimize background writer performance, particularly in workloads with frequent writes, while ensuring it doesn't exceed the available memory limits for your system.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 None

                DESCRIPTION:
                When this parameter is on, the PostgreSQL server compresses a full page image written to WAL when full_page_writes is on or during a base backup. A compressed page image will be decompressed during WAL replay. The default value is off. Only superusers can change this setting.
Turning this parameter on can reduce the WAL volume without increasing the risk of unrecoverable data corruption, but at the cost of some extra CPU spent on the compression during WAL logging and on the decompression during WAL replay.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To optimize the `enable_mergejoin` setting in PostgreSQL, it is generally recommended to set its value to `on` (1) to allow the use of merge joins under normal circumstances, while setting it to `off` (0) in specific queries where you want to avoid merge join usage, particularly in cases with small result sets or when there's a presumed performance issue identified through query planning.

 None

                DESCRIPTION:
                When this parameter is on, the PostgreSQL server writes the entire content of each disk page to WAL during the first modification of that page after a checkpoint. This is needed because a page write that is in process during an operating system crash might be only partially completed, leading to an on-disk page that contains a mix of old and new data. The row-level change data normally stored in WAL will not be enough to completely restore such a page during post-crash recovery. Storing the full page image guarantees that the page can be correctly restored, but at the price of increasing the amount of data that must be written to WAL. (Because WAL replay always starts from a checkpoint, it is sufficient to do this during the first change of each page after a checkpoint. Therefore, one way to reduce the cost of full-page writes is to increase the checkpoint interval parameters.)
Turning this parameter off speeds normal operation, but might lead to either unrecoverable data corruption, or silent data corruption, after a system failure. The risks are similar to turning off fsync, though smaller, and it should be turned off only based on the same circumstances recommended for that parameter.
Turning off this parameter does not affect use of WAL archiving for point-in-time recovery (PITR) (see Section 25.3).
This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. The default is on.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".

                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that PostgreSQL expects can be executed simultaneously. Raising this value will increase the number of I/O operations that any individual PostgreSQL session attempts to initiate in parallel. The allowed range is 1 to 1000, or zero to disable issuance of asynchronous I/O requests. Currently, this setting only affects bitmap heap scans.
For magnetic drives, a good starting point for this setting is the number of separate drives comprising a RAID 0 stripe or RAID 1 mirror being used for the database. (For RAID 5 the parity drive should not be counted.) However, if the database is often busy with multiple queries issued in concurrent sessions, lower values may be sufficient to keep the disk array busy. A value higher than needed to keep the disks busy will only result in extra CPU overhead. SSDs and other memory-based storage can often process many concurrent requests, so the best value might be in the hundreds.
Asynchronous I/O depends on an effective posix_fadvise function, which some operating systems lack. If the function is not present then setting this parameter to anything but zero will result in an error. On some operating systems (e.g., Solaris), the function is present but does not actually do anything.
The default is 1 on supported systems, otherwise 0. This value can be overridden for tables in a particular tablespace by setting the tablespace parameter of the same name (see ALTER TABLESPACE).

Summerize the description for knob 'enable_partitionwise_join' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Enables or disables the query planner's use of partitionwise join, which allows a join between partitioned tables to be performed by joining the matching partitions. Partitionwise join currently applies only when the join conditions include all the partition keys, which must be of the same data type and have one-to-one matching sets of child partitions. With this setting enabled, the number of nodes whose memory usage is restricted by work_mem appearing in the final plan can increase linearly according to the number of partitions being scanned. This can result in a large increase in overall memory consumption during the execution of the query. Query planning also becomes significantly more expensive in terms of memory and CPU. The default value is off.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Allows the use of parallel queries for testing purposes even in cases where no performance benefit is expected. The allowed values of force_parallel_mode are off (use parallel mode only when it is expected to improve performance), on (force parallel query for all queries for which it is thought to be safe), and regress (like on, but with additional behavior changes as explained below).
More specifically, setting this value to on will add a Gather node to the top of any query plan for which this appears to be safe, so that the query runs inside of a parallel worker. Even when a parallel worker is not available or cannot be used, operations such as starting a subtransaction that would be prohibited in a parallel query context will be prohibited unless the planner believes that this will cause the query to fail. If failures or unexpected results occur when this option is set, some functions used by the query may need to be marked PARALLEL UNSAFE (or, possibly, PARALLEL RESTRICTED).
Setting this value to regress has all of the same effects as setting it to on plus some additional effects that are intended to facilitate automated regression testing. Normally, messages from a parallel worker include a context line indicating that, but a setting of regress suppresses this line so that the output is the same as in non-parallel execution. Also, the Gather nodes added to plans by this setting are hidden in EXPLAIN output so that the output matches what would be obtained if this setting were turned off.

Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

OFFICIAL_DOC:

Now let's think step by step and give me the result in legal json format:

                DESCRIPTION:
                The amount of shared memory used for WAL data that has not yet been written to disk. The default setting of -1 selects a size equal to 1/32nd (about 3%) of shared_buffers, but not less than 64kB nor more than the size of one WAL segment, typically 16MB. This value can be set manually if the automatic choice is too large or too small, but any positive value less than 32kB will be treated as 32kB. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as WAL blocks, that is XLOG_BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. This parameter can only be set at server start.
The contents of the WAL buffers are written out to disk at every transaction commit, so extremely large values are unlikely to provide a significant benefit. However, setting this value to at least a few megabytes can improve write performance on a busy server where many clients are committing at once. The auto-tuning selected by the default setting of -1 should give reasonable results in most cases.

Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

DESCRIPTION:
Sets the default statistics target for table columns without a column-specific target set via ALTER TABLE SET STATISTICS. Larger values increase the time needed to do ANALYZE, but might improve the quality of the planner's estimates. The default is 100. For more information on the use of statistics by the PostgreSQL query planner, refer to Section 14.2.

Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

OFFICIAL_DOC:
{'boot_val': 'on', 'category': 'Autovacuum', 'context': 'sighup', 'enumvals': None, 'extra_desc': None, 'max_val': None, 'min_val': None, 'name': 'autovacuum', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': 'on', 'setting': 'on', 'short_desc': 'Starts the autovacuum subprocess.', 'source': 'default', 'sourcefile': None, 'sourceline': None, 'unit': None, 'vartype': 'bool'}

Now let's think step by step and give me the result in legal json format:
    {
        "gpt_suggestion": null ,   // if the original suggestion is empty, return null, else return the corresponding answer.
        "web_suggestion": null,  // if the original suggestion is empty, return null, else return the corresponding answer.

                Summerize the description for knob 'synchronous_commit' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies how much WAL processing must complete before the database server returns a “success” indication to the client. Valid values are remote_apply, on (the default), remote_write, local, and off.
If synchronous_standby_names is empty, the only meaningful settings are on and off; remote_apply, remote_write and local all provide the same local synchronization level as on. The local behavior of all non-off modes is to wait for local flush of WAL to disk. In off mode, there is no waiting, so there can be a delay between when success is reported to the client and when the transaction is later guaranteed to be safe against a server crash. (The maximum delay is three times wal_writer_delay.) Unlike fsync, setting this parameter to off does not create any risk of database inconsistency: an operating system or database crash might result in some recent allegedly-committed transactions being lost, but the database state will be just the same as if those transactions had been aborted cleanly. So, turning synchronous_commit off can be a useful alternative when performance is more important than exact certainty about the durability of a transaction. For more discussion see Section 29.3.
If synchronous_standby_names is non-empty, synchronous_commit also controls whether transaction commits will wait for their WAL records to be processed on the standby server(s).
When set to remote_apply, commits will wait until replies from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received the commit record of the transaction and applied it, so that it has become visible to queries on the standby(s), and also written to durable storage on the standbys. This will cause much larger commit delays than previous settings since it waits for WAL replay. When set to on, commits wait until replies from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received the commit record of the transaction and flushed it to durable storage. This ensures the transaction will not be lost unless both the primary and all synchronous standbys suffer corruption of their database storage. When set to remote_write, commits will wait until replies from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received the commit record of the transaction and written it to their file systems. This setting ensures data preservation if a standby instance of PostgreSQL crashes, but not if the standby suffers an operating-system-level crash because the data has not necessarily reached durable storage on the standby. The setting local causes commits to wait for local flush to disk, but not for replication. This is usually not desirable when synchronous replication is in use, but is provided for completeness.
This parameter can be changed at any time; the behavior for any one transaction is determined by the setting in effect when it commits. It is therefore possible, and useful, to have some transactions commit synchronously and others asynchronously. For example, to make a single multistatement transaction commit asynchronously when the default is the opposite, issue SET LOCAL synchronous_commit TO OFF within the transaction.
Table 19.1 summarizes the capabilities of the synchronous_commit settings.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To optimize the 'synchronous_commit' setting in PostgreSQL, you can set it to 'on' for maximum durability (default), 'off' for improved write performance with potential data loss in case of a crash, or 'local' to ensure that commits are acknowledged once they are written to the local disk, which can improve performance while still providing a level of safety; you might also consider setting it to 'remote_write' for a balance between performance and safety, ensuring writes are acknowledged after they are sent to synchronous standby servers.

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:
 {'boot_val': 'on', 'category': 'Statistics / Query and Index Statistics Collector', 'context': 'superuser', 'enumvals': None, 'extra_desc': None, 'max_val': None, 'min_val': None, 'name': 'track_counts', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': 'on', 'setting': 'on', 'short_desc': 'Collects statistics on database activity.', 'source': 'default', 'sourcefile': None, 'sourceline': None, 'unit': None, 'vartype': 'bool'}
 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value of the 'track_counts' knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (set it to 'on'), as this allows the system to collect statistics for active database objects, which can be particularly useful for performance tuning; typically, this is left at its default of 'on' unless there is a specific reason to disable tracking.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 None

                DESCRIPTION:
                Abort any statement that takes more than the specified amount of time. If log_min_error_statement is set to ERROR or lower, the statement that timed out will also be logged. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. A value of zero (the default) disables the timeout.
The timeout is measured from the time a command arrives at the server until it is completed by the server. If multiple SQL statements appear in a single simple-Query message, the timeout is applied to each statement separately. (PostgreSQL versions before 13 usually treated the timeout as applying to the whole query string.) In extended query protocol, the timeout starts running when any query-related message (Parse, Bind, Execute, Describe) arrives, and it is canceled by completion of an Execute or Sync message.
Setting statement_timeout in postgresql.conf is not recommended because it would affect all sessions.

DESCRIPTION:
Maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as seconds. The valid range is between 30 seconds and one day. The default is five minutes (5min). Increasing this parameter can increase the amount of time needed for crash recovery. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

                Summerize the description for knob 'wal_level' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                wal_level determines how much information is written to the WAL. The default value is replica, which writes enough data to support WAL archiving and replication, including running read-only queries on a standby server. minimal removes all logging except the information required to recover from a crash or immediate shutdown. Finally, logical adds information necessary to support logical decoding. Each level includes the information logged at all lower levels. This parameter can only be set at server start.
The minimal level generates the least WAL volume. It logs no row information for permanent relations in transactions that create or rewrite them. This can make operations much faster (see Section 14.4.7). Operations that initiate this optimization include:
But minimal WAL does not contain enough information to reconstruct the data from a base backup and the WAL logs, so replica or higher must be used to enable WAL archiving (archive_mode) and streaming replication.
In logical level, the same information is logged as with replica, plus information needed to allow extracting logical change sets from the WAL. Using a level of logical will increase the WAL volume, particularly if many tables are configured for REPLICA IDENTITY FULL and many UPDATE and DELETE statements are executed.
In releases prior to 9.6, this parameter also allowed the values archive and hot_standby. These are still accepted but mapped to replica.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:
 {'boot_val': 'replica', 'category': 'Write-Ahead Log / Settings', 'context': 'postmaster', 'enumvals': ['minimal', 'replica', 'logical'], 'extra_desc': None, 'max_val': None, 'min_val': None, 'name': 'wal_level', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': 'replica', 'setting': 'replica', 'short_desc': 'Sets the level of information written to the WAL.', 'source': 'default', 'sourcefile': None, 'sourceline': None, 'unit': None, 'vartype': 'enum'}
 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the 'wal_level' parameter in PostgreSQL, choose between the values 'minimal' for basic replication and point-in-time recovery, 'replica' for supporting physical replication and logical decoding (recommended for most setups), or 'logical' to enable logical replication, with 'replica' being the default setting that suits most production environments.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 None

 Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format.:
 {
     "gpt_suggestion": null ,   // if there is a contradiction, remove the contradictory part, else return the corresponding original suggestion.
     "web_suggestion": null   // if there is a contradiction, remove the contradictory part, else return the corresponding original suggestion.

I will give you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres. Your job is to find contradictions between the given suggestions. If there is contradictory information between certain suggestions, especially the contradictions of values, keep the information provided by the higher-priority suggestion and only remove the contradictory information provided by the lower-priority suggestion. Do not remove the other information. The priority is defined in sequence as "manual_suggestion, web_suggestion, gpt_suggestion" from higher to lower. So manual_suggestion should not be changed. If there is contradiction within the same suggestion, keep it.  Try to make your summary encapsulates information from the three suggestions as much as possible except from the contradictory parts.    
THREE SUGGESTIONS:

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

OFFICIAL_DOC:
