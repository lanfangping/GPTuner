{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question, which is 'statement_timeout'. 2. Understand the purpose of 'statement_timeout' in PostgreSQL, which is to set a limit on the duration of statement execution. 3. Check if there are any special values associated with this knob. 4. Determine if the special values (like -1 or 0) change the behavior of the knob significantly. In PostgreSQL, setting 'statement_timeout' to 0 disables the timeout, while setting it to -1 means no timeout is enforced. 5. Since 'statement_timeout' has special values that alter its function, classify it as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": [0, -1]}
