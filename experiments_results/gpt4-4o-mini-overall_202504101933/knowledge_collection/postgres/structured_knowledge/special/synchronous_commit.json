{"think_procedure": "The knob 'synchronous_commit' in PostgreSQL controls the behavior of transaction commits regarding their synchronization with the WAL (Write-Ahead Logging). It can take values such as 'on', 'off', 'local', and 'remote_write'. However, it also has a special value of 'off', which can be considered a special case as it disables synchronous commit altogether, leading to different behavior in transaction durability. Therefore, I need to classify whether it qualifies as a special knob based on the presence of such a special value.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
