{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' in PostgreSQL is used to set the maximum cost that the autovacuum process can incur during a single vacuum operation. It is a numerical value that typically has a natural order, where higher values allow for more resources to be used during vacuuming. However, there is no special value like -1 or 0 that alters its fundamental operation. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob without any special functionality tied to specific values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
