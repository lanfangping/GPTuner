{"think_procedure": "The knob 'default_statistics_target' in PostgreSQL is used to set the default statistics target for table columns. It typically has a range of positive integer values that determine the level of statistics collected to optimize query planning. A special value like -1 or 0 would indicate a different operation, such as disabling the feature or indicating that no statistics should be collected. However, 'default_statistics_target' does not have such special values that alter its function significantly. Hence, it operates within a natural order of positive integers without special cases.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
