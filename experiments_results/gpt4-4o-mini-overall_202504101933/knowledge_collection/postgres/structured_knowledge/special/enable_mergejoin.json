{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_mergejoin' controls whether the merge join algorithm is used in query planning. It is a boolean setting that can typically be set to true or false, where true enables merge joins and false disables them. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that change its function significantly, so it doesn't break the natural order of numerical knobs. Therefore, it does not qualify as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
