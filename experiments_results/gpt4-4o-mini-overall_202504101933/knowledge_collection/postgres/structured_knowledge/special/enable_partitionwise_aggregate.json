{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_partitionwise_aggregate' controls whether PostgreSQL uses partition-wise aggregation for queries involving partitioned tables. It is a numerical knob that can be set to either 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled). Since 0 is a special value that disables the feature, and 1 is a regular operational value, it indicates that this knob has a special value that alters its behavior significantly. Therefore, it is classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
