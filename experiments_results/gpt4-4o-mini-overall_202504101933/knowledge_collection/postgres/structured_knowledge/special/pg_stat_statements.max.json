{"think_procedure": "The knob 'pg_stat_statements.max' controls the maximum number of statements tracked by the pg_stat_statements module in PostgreSQL. It is a numerical knob that typically has a natural order as it defines a limit. However, it has a special value of -1, which indicates that there is no limit on the number of statements tracked. Therefore, this knob can be considered a special knob because of its special value of -1 that changes its behavior significantly from its regular operation.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
