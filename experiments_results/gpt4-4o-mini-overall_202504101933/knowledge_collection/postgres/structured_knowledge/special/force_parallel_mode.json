{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question, which is 'force_parallel_mode'. 2. Research the functionality of 'force_parallel_mode' in PostgreSQL. 3. Determine if 'force_parallel_mode' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly compared to regular numerical settings. 4. Confirm whether the knob has a natural order of values or if it includes special values like -1 or 0 that change its function. 5. Based on the findings, classify 'force_parallel_mode' as a special knob or not.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
