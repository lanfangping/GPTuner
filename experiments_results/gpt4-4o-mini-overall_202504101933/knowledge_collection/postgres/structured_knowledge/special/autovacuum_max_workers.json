{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_max_workers' controls the maximum number of autovacuum worker processes that can run at the same time. It is a numerical setting that defines a limit on the number of workers. The natural order is maintained as higher values correspond to more workers. However, if set to 0, it disables autovacuum, which is a special behavior. The value -1 is not applicable in this context. Therefore, since it has a special value (0) that alters its normal function, it can be classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
