{"think_procedure": "The knob 'checkpoint_flush_after' is used to specify the number of bytes written to the WAL (Write-Ahead Log) before a checkpoint is triggered. It is a numerical knob that typically has a natural order based on the number of bytes. However, it does not have special values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a different behavior or disable the feature. Therefore, it behaves as a regular numerical knob without any special cases.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
