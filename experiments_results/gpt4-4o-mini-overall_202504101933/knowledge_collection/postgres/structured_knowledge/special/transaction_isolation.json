{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question, which is 'transaction_isolation'. 2. Understand the purpose of the 'transaction_isolation' knob in PostgreSQL, which controls the isolation level of transactions. 3. Determine if there are any special values associated with this knob. In PostgreSQL, the 'transaction_isolation' knob can be set to various levels like 'read committed', 'serializable', etc., but it does not have special values like -1 or 0 that change its fundamental behavior. 4. Conclude that 'transaction_isolation' does not break the natural order of numerical knobs and does not have a special value that alters its operation significantly.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
