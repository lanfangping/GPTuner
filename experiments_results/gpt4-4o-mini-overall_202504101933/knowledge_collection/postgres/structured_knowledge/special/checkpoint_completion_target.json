{"think_procedure": "The knob 'checkpoint_completion_target' in PostgreSQL is used to specify the target duration for checkpoint completion as a fraction of the checkpoint interval. It is a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 means that the checkpoint should be completed as quickly as possible, and values closer to 1 indicate a longer duration for the checkpoint process. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that change its function drastically. Therefore, it follows a natural order without special cases.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
