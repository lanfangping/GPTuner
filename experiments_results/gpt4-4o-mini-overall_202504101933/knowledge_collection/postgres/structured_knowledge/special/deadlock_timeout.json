Determine if there are any special values associated with it, such as -1 or 0, that change its behavior significantly. 4. Research the documentation to confirm that a value of 0 means to disable the deadlock detection. 5. Conclude that since it has a special value (0) that alters its function, it qualifies as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
