{"think_procedure": "The knob 'wal_block_size' in PostgreSQL determines the size of the write-ahead log (WAL) blocks. It is a numerical setting that typically has a natural order as it can be set to various sizes. However, it does not have special values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a different function or disable a feature. Thus, it behaves as a regular numerical knob without any special cases.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
