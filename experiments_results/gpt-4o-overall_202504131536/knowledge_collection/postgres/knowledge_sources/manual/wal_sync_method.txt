The 'wal_sync_method' parameter determines the method used for forcing WAL updates to disk with possible values including open_datasync, fdatasync, fsync, fsync_writethrough, and open_sync, with the default being platform-specific, typically fdatasync for Linux and FreeBSD, but must be configured carefully in postgresql.conf or via the server command line to ensure crash safety and performance.
