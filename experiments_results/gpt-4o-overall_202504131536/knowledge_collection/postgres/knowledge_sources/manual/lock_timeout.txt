The `lock_timeout` parameter aborts any statement that waits more than the specified time, in milliseconds, to acquire a lock on a database object, with a default of 0 (disabled), and applies to both explicit and implicit locking requests, although setting it in postgresql.conf is not advised as it affects all sessions.
