The `statement_timeout` knob in PostgreSQL aborts any statement exceeding the specified time limit, measured in milliseconds, with a default of zero (disabling the timeout); it applies individually to each SQL statement in a simple-Query message and starts from the first query-related message in extended protocols, but setting it in postgresql.conf is not advised as it impacts all sessions.
