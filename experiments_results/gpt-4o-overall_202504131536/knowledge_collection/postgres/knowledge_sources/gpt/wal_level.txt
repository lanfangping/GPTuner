For optimal tuning of the 'wal_level' knob in PostgreSQL, set it to 'replica' for streaming replication setups, 'logical' for using logical replication or decoding, and retain 'minimal' if neither replication nor standby servers are required, ensuring to align these choices with PostgreSQL's version-specific defaults and capabilities.
