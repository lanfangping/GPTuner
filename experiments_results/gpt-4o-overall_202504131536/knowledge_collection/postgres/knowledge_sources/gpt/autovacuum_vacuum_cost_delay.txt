To set the value of 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' in PostgreSQL, you should balance the performance impact of autovacuum operations with the workload requirements, typically starting with the default value of 20 milliseconds and adjusting it, either decreasing to reduce the delay for more aggressive autovacuuming or increasing up to 100 milliseconds or more to reduce the impact on concurrent query performance.
