In PostgreSQL, the 'block_size' knob is typically set at compile time and determines the size of the disk block, with a default value of 8 KB; it can be set between 1 KB and 32 KB, but changes generally require recompilation and should match the system's I/O and workload characteristics for optimal performance.
