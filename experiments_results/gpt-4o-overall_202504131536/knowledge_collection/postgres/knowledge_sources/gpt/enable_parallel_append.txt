To set the value for the knob 'enable_parallel_append' in PostgreSQL, adjust it to either 'on' to enable parallel append operations, which can enhance query performance by leveraging parallel processing, or 'off' to disable it, typically defaulting to 'on' for better performance in environments utilizing parallel queries, unless testing or specific use cases suggest otherwise.
