The 'autovacuum' knob in PostgreSQL can be set to 'on' (the default) to enable the automatic vacuuming process, with adjustments like 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' set to 50 tuples and 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' set to 0.2 for more aggressive vacuuming, depending on the workload and size of your database.
