The value for the 'join_collapse_limit' knob in PostgreSQL should be set based on the complexity of your queries, with a lower number like 8 or 10 used to limit the planner's effort in considering multiple join permutations, which can help improve performance on simpler queries, while higher values or even the default (12) can be used if your workload involves complex queries with many joins where exhaustive planning is beneficial.
