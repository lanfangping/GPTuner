To set the value for the 'max_worker_processes' knob in PostgreSQL, consider configuring it to the lesser of the number of CPU cores available or a benchmarking-based assessment, typically starting from 2 and adjusting upwards in increments based on performance tests, up to a recommended maximum of 8 for OLTP workloads or aligning closer to the number of cores for OLAP systems.
