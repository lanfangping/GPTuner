To set the 'autovacuum_naptime' knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it to control the frequency of the autovacuum process, with the default setting being 60 seconds, but it may be increased for less frequent vacuuming on systems with less active tables, or decreased to 10 seconds for systems with high update rates and the need for more aggressive cleanup.
