To set the value for 'max_wal_size' in Postgres, start with a default of 1 GB and adjust it based on your available storage and workload requirements, often setting it between 2 GB to 8 GB for moderate workloads, but potentially higher for write-heavy applications to prevent frequent WAL file checkpoints.
