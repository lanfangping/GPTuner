To set the value for the 'enable_parallel_hash' knob in PostgreSQL, you can use the SQL command `SET enable_parallel_hash = {on|off};`, where 'on' enables parallel hash joins, potentially improving performance for large datasets, while 'off' disables this feature, forcing the execution to use a non-parallel plan.
