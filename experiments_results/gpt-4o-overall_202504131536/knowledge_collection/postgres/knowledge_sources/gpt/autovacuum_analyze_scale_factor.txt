To set the value for the 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, consider adjusting it based on your update activity, typically starting with a lower value such as 0.05 for more frequent analyze operations in highly active tables, while a higher default of 0.1 could be sufficient for tables with less frequent updates.
