To set the value for 'max_parallel_workers' in PostgreSQL, it is generally recommended to align it with the number of CPU cores available, typically starting from 2 to 4 for moderate workloads and adjusting upwards based on system capabilities and workload characteristics, while considering that values beyond the number of CPU cores could lead to diminishing returns or increased contention.
