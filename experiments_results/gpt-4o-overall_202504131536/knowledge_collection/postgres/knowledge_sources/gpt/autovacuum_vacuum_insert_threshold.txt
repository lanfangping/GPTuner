To set the value for 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' in PostgreSQL, consider setting it to a baseline of around 1,000 to 3,000 insert operations, adjusting higher if bulk insert operations are frequent, or lower if there is a need to initiate vacuum processes more aggressively to maintain table health and performance.
