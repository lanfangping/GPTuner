work_mem
TUNING_SUGGESTION:
{'suggestion': "To effectively configure the 'work_mem' setting in PostgreSQL, start by determining the base maximum memory used per query operation, such as sort or hash tables, before resorting to temporary disk usage. Consider allocating about 25% of the available memory for queries, adjusting based on query complexity and system workload. For OLTP queries that do not require complex joins or sorting large amounts of data, keep this value in the low MBs. For OLAP-style queries and fewer concurrent queries, it may grow into the GB range. Multiply by max_connections * N (where N is a small single-digit number) to estimate the maximum potential memory consumption by the Postgres process. Adjust as needed, potentially increasing the default value, which is often too small for modern systems. Christophe Pettus suggests starting with 16MB for most users. Additionally, consider the impact of 'hash_mem_multiplier' on hash operations, and adjust based on the performance and stability of your system."}

autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit
TUNING_SUGGESTION:
{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' in PostgreSQL, set it in the 'postgresql.conf' file or via the server command line. This parameter specifies the cost limit for automatic VACUUM operations, defaulting to -1 to use the regular 'vacuum_cost_limit' value. The limit is distributed among autovacuum workers to ensure it does not exceed the set value. For systems with higher I/O capacity, consider adjusting the value upwards from the default to allow more aggressive vacuuming, while monitoring system performance to avoid resource contention. Additionally, individual table settings can be specified using storage parameters."}

I first give you a knob of postgres, determine if it is related to resources, focusing primarily on CPU, RAM, disk size, and disk type. Note that some knobs may not appear directly related to resources but are indeed associated with them, so please exercise careful discernment. 

let's think step by step

step 1: Summarize the function of  knob from postgres  with no more than five sentences.
step 2: Judge whether this knob is related to cpu, ram, disk type or disk size.
step 3: If the knob is related to any hardware resource in step 2, return the boolean value true, otherwise, return the boolean value false.

Please give me the result in json format.
