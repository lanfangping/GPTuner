{'suggestion': "For optimal performance in PostgreSQL, set the 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' parameter based on your specific workload and hardware capabilities. The default value is 2, and setting it to 0 will disable parallel queries. For high throughput OLTP systems, keep the value low, ideally at 1 or 2, to prevent excessive resource utilization. For analytical or data warehouse systems, consider increasing it to a fraction of available CPU cores while ensuring it does not exceed cores minus one. Be cautious, as parallel queries can significantly increase resource usage, potentially up to 5 times more with 4 workers. Additionally, review the 'work_mem' setting as it influences this parameter's effectiveness."}
