{'suggestion': "To configure the 'bgwriter_lru_maxpages' parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to control the maximum number of buffers the background writer can write per round, with a default value of 100. This parameter can be adjusted to increase the activity of the background writer, especially in busy databases, by setting it between 100 and 1000 based on system performance and workload testing. It can also be disabled by setting the value to zero. Ensure this configuration is done in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line."}
