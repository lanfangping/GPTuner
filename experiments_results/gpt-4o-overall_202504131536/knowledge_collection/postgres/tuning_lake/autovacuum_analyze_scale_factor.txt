{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on your table's update activity. This setting determines the additional table size percentage added to the 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold' to trigger an ANALYZE operation. It can be configured globally in the postgresql.conf file or the server command line, and adjusted per table using storage parameters. Consider starting with a lower value like 0.05 for tables with high update activity to ensure more frequent analyze operations, while a default of 0.1 might suffice for tables with less frequent updates."}
