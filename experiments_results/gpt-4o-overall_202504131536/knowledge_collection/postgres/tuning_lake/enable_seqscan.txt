{'suggestion': "The 'enable_seqscan' knob in PostgreSQL, which defaults to 'on,' discourages but does not completely prevent the query planner from using sequential scan plan types when alternative methods are available. To manage this setting, you can use the command `SET enable_seqscan = on;` to enable sequential scans or `SET enable_seqscan = off;` to discourage their use, thereby encouraging the optimizer to consider alternative query execution plans."}
