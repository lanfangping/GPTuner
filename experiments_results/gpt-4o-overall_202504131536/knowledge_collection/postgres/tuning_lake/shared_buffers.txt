{'suggestion': "For configuring the 'shared_buffers' setting in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to allocate approximately 25% of the total system RAM, ensuring not to exceed 40% to prevent overshadowing the OS cache. This is particularly applicable for dedicated servers with at least 1GB of RAM. For systems with large memory capacities, consider utilizing huge pages. It's crucial to adjust the allocation for non-dedicated servers, as each PostgreSQL instance reserves its own memory. Additionally, ensure that this setting aligns with the OS kernel parameters 'shmmax' and 'shmall'. Conduct benchmarks to determine the optimal configuration for your specific setup."}
