{'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance, set the 'checkpoint_timeout' knob to manage the interval between automatic WAL checkpoints. The default is 5 minutes, which can be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. While increasing the timeout can lead to larger I/O spikes and longer recovery times after a crash, it typically improves overall I/O usage. Consider balancing the timeout setting with adjustments to 'checkpoint_completion_target' and 'bgwriter' activity to smooth out I/O spikes."}
