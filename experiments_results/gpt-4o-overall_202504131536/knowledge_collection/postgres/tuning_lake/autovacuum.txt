{'suggestion': "To effectively manage the autovacuum process in PostgreSQL, adjust the 'autovacuum' knob to control the activation of the autovacuum launcher daemon. Ensure that 'track_counts' is active, as it is required for autovacuum to function properly. The settings for autovacuum can be modified in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. While autovacuum can be disabled for individual tables through storage parameters, it is important to note that autovacuum processes may still run to prevent transaction ID wraparound, ensuring database stability and performance."}
