{'suggestion': "The 'jit' knob in PostgreSQL, which specifies if Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation can be utilized, is enabled by default as detailed in Chapter 31. While it is generally beneficial for accelerating query execution, especially in complex queries, it may be advisable to disable it for OLTP systems with simple queries where JIT's impact might be negligible or could lead to increased resource usage. The actual impact should be evaluated based on specific system and query conditions."}
