{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, set its value in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. The default value is 0.2, which adds 20% of the table size to the autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold to determine when to trigger a VACUUM. This setting can be customized per table through storage parameters. For large, insert-heavy tables, consider adjusting this value to ensure more frequent maintenance, potentially lowering it to 0.05 (5%) to better manage the workload."}
