{'suggestion': "The 'checkpoint_flush_after' parameter in PostgreSQL specifies the amount of data that triggers forced writeback to underlying storage during a checkpoint. This setting helps limit kernel page cache dirty data, potentially reducing transaction latency. The default value is 256kB on Linux and 0 elsewhere. Adjusting this parameter can impact performance based on I/O characteristics, balancing between write performance and data integrity."}
