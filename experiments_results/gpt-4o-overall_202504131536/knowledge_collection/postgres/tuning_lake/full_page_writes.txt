{'suggestion': "The 'full_page_writes' parameter in PostgreSQL should be enabled by default to ensure data integrity by writing the entire content of each disk page to the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) during its first modification after a checkpoint. While enabling this parameter increases WAL data, it is crucial for preventing data corruption, akin to the risks associated with disabling fsync. Although disabling 'full_page_writes' can speed up operations, it should only be considered on systems with a reliable power source and low risk of crashes. It is advisable to thoroughly test the impact under your specific workload before making changes."}
