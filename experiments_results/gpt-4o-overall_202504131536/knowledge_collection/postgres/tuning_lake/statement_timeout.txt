{'suggestion': "To configure the 'statement_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL, specify the time in milliseconds to limit the execution duration of any SQL statement, ensuring it does not exceed the set time limit. This timeout applies individually to each SQL statement, starting from the first query-related message in extended protocols. It's recommended to avoid setting this in the postgresql.conf file, as it will affect all sessions globally."}
