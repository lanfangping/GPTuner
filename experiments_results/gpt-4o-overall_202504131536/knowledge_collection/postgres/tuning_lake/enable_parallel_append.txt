{'suggestion': "The 'enable_parallel_append' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of parallel-aware append plans. It is generally set to 'on' by default to enhance query performance by leveraging parallel processing. Adjust this setting to 'off' only if specific use cases or testing scenarios require it."}
