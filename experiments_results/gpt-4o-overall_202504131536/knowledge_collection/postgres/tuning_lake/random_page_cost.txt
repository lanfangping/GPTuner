{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'random_page_cost' setting in PostgreSQL, which defaults to 4.0, adjust this value based on the actual caching conditions and the type of storage technology used. For solid-state drives (SSDs) with lower random read costs, consider decreasing it closer to 1.1, as SSDs have a faster random access profile. This adjustment reflects the planner's estimated cost of fetching a non-sequential disk page and should account for the assumption that 90% of random reads are cached. For traditional spinning disks, the value might remain closer to the default if performance permits."}
