{'suggestion': "To configure 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, adjust the setting in the postgresql.conf file or via server command line, with the option to override it per table. This parameter determines when VACUUM is triggered, based on the percentage of table changes relative to its size. Start with a default of 0.2, meaning 20% of table rows need to change before an autovacuum is initiated. For large, frequently updated tables, consider reducing this value to 0.05 or lower to ensure timely vacuum operations. Conversely, for smaller, less active tables, or if disk space is not a constraint, a higher setting may be appropriate to delay autovacuum operations."}
