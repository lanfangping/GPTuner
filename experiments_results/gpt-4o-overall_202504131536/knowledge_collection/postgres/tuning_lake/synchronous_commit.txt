{'suggestion': "The 'synchronous_commit' setting in PostgreSQL is crucial for determining the level of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) completion required before the server acknowledges a transaction as successful to the client. To configure this setting, consider the trade-off between performance and durability. Setting it to 'off' can enhance performance but may lead to potential data loss in the event of a crash. The 'local' setting minimizes commit wait times on the local server, while 'remote_write' ensures commit waits only for WAL writes to remote servers. For full commit confirmation, use 'on', which requires both local and remote applications. For the highest durability, choose 'remote_apply', which ensures all changes are applied and visible on synchronous standbys, though this may result in larger delays. Adjust the setting based on your specific needs for performance and data safety."}
