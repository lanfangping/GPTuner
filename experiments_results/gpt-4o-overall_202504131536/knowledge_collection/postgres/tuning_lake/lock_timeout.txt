{'suggestion': "Set the 'lock_timeout' parameter in Postgres to abort any statement that waits more than a specified time, in milliseconds, to acquire a lock on a database object. Avoid setting it in postgresql.conf to prevent affecting all sessions. Instead, configure it at the session level or within specific transactions based on your workload and performance needs. The default value is 0 (disabled), and it applies to both explicit and implicit locking requests. Consider starting with a few seconds, such as 2,000 milliseconds, and adjust as necessary to balance application requirements and avoid long waits."}
