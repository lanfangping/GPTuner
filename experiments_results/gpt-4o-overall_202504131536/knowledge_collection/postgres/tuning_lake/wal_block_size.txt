{'suggestion': "The 'wal_block_size' parameter in PostgreSQL specifies the disk block size for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL). This value defaults to a server-defined setting, which is determined by the XLOG_BLCKSZ value during the server's construction process. It is important to note that this setting is established during the server setup and aligns with the server's configuration standards."}
