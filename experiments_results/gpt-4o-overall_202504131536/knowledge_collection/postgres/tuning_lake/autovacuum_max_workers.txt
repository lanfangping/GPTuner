{'suggestion': "To effectively configure the 'autovacuum_max_workers' parameter in PostgreSQL, set the maximum number of concurrent autovacuum processes to three by default, as this must be configured at server start. For larger systems with high transaction volumes, consider increasing this value to balance vacuuming efficiency with system resources. Additionally, if you rely on this parameter for feeding non-streaming replicas, ensure it remains within a low percentage to maintain system stability."}
