{'suggestion': "To configure 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' in PostgreSQL, set it to a default of 1,000 tuples, which determines the number of inserted tuples needed to trigger a VACUUM on a table. This setting can be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file, server command line, or for individual tables through storage parameters. Consider increasing the threshold if bulk insert operations are frequent, or decreasing it for more aggressive vacuuming to maintain table health and performance."}
