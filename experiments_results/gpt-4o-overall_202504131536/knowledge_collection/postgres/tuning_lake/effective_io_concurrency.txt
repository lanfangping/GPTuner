{'suggestion': "For optimal performance in PostgreSQL, configure the 'effective_io_concurrency' setting based on your storage type and system capabilities. This setting is crucial for managing concurrent disk I/O operations, especially during bitmap heap scans. For SSDs, you may consider setting this value to potentially hundreds, provided that your system supports asynchronous I/O with an operational 'posix_fadvise' function. Adjustments should be made to align with the specific characteristics of your storage system to maximize efficiency."}
