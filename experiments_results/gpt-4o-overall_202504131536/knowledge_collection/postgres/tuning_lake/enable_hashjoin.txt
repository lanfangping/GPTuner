{'suggestion': "For the 'enable_hashjoin' knob in Postgres, it is recommended to keep its default value set to 'on'. This setting allows the query planner to utilize hash-join plan types, which can be beneficial for query performance. Adjusting this setting to 'off' may be considered if hash joins are determined to be inefficient for specific queries."}
