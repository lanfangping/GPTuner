{'suggestion': "The 'wal_writer_delay' parameter in PostgreSQL controls the interval at which the WAL writer flushes data to the WAL, with a default setting of 200 milliseconds. However, on many systems, the effective sleep delay resolution is 10 milliseconds, which can influence how this value is applied. Consider adjusting this parameter based on system requirements; a lower value like 10ms may be suitable for systems needing frequent WAL writes to minimize data loss, while the default of 200ms can help reduce write overhead on less performance-critical systems."}
