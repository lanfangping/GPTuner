{'suggestion': "The 'wal_buffers' parameter in PostgreSQL should be configured at server start to optimize performance, particularly in busy environments. It determines the amount of shared memory allocated for WAL data not yet written to disk, with a default setting of 1/32nd (approximately 3%) of shared_buffers. Consider starting with the default setting and adjusting based on your transaction volume and WAL usage to ensure efficient write-ahead logging performance."}
