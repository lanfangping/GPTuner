{'suggestion': "The 'enable_nestloop' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's preference for nested-loop join plans, with a default setting of 'on'. It is recommended to keep it enabled unless more efficient methods, such as hash or merge joins, are available for larger datasets. To determine the optimal setting, assess performance through testing with representative queries and monitor execution costs."}
