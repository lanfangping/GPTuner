            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            KNOB: work_mem
            SUGGESTION: {'suggestion': "To effectively configure the 'work_mem' setting in PostgreSQL, start by determining the base maximum memory used per query operation, such as sort or hash tables, before resorting to temporary disk usage. Consider allocating about 25% of the available memory for queries, adjusting based on query complexity and system workload. For OLTP queries that do not require complex joins or sorting large amounts of data, keep this value in the low MBs.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.

Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value".

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

            SUGGESTION: {'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance, set the 'checkpoint_timeout' knob to manage the interval between automatic WAL checkpoints. The default is 5 minutes, which can be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.

Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.

Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Database Management Systems (DBMS) have settings referred to as 'knobs'. Numerical knobs typically have a natural order. However, some 'special' numerical knobs have special values, such as -1 or 0, that break this natural order. When set to a special value, such knob performs a very different function compared to its regular operation, such as disabling a feature. Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob. Let us think step by step, please classify a knob of postgresas a 'special knob' and provide the RESULT in JSON format.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

<example>
KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache.

Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.
            </step>

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            SUGGESTION: {'suggestion': "To configure 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, adjust the setting in the postgresql.conf file or via server command line, with the option to override it per table. This parameter determines when VACUUM is triggered, based on the percentage of table changes relative to its size. Start with a default of 0.2, meaning 20% of table rows need to change before an autovacuum is initiated. For large, frequently updated tables, consider reducing this value to 0.05 or lower to ensure timely vacuum operations. Conversely, for smaller, less active tables, or if disk space is not a constraint, a higher setting may be appropriate to delay autovacuum operations."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

"min_value": null,

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

<example>
KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given.

This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.

This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.

So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

However, on many systems, the effective sleep delay resolution is 10 milliseconds, which can influence how this value is applied. Consider adjusting this parameter based on system requirements; a lower value like 10ms may be suitable for systems needing frequent WAL writes to minimize data loss, while the default of 200ms can help reduce write overhead on less performance-critical systems."}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

            SUGGESTION: {'suggestion': "The 'wal_writer_delay' parameter in PostgreSQL controls the interval at which the WAL writer flushes data to the WAL, with a default setting of 200 milliseconds. However, on many systems, the effective sleep delay resolution is 10 milliseconds, which can influence how this value is applied. Consider adjusting this parameter based on system requirements; a lower value like 10ms may be suitable for systems needing frequent WAL writes to minimize data loss, while the default of 200ms can help reduce write overhead on less performance-critical systems."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            KNOB: checkpoint_completion_target
            SUGGESTION: {'suggestion': "To configure the 'checkpoint_completion_target' in PostgreSQL, set this parameter in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. It defines the goal for completing checkpoints as a fraction of the interval time between them. While the default value is 0.5, it is suggested to adjust this value between 0.5 and 0.9. Setting it closer to 0.9 can help to evenly distribute checkpoint I/O and minimize performance spikes, especially in development environments. However, if you rely on this setting for non-streaming replicas, consider using a lower percentage to ensure optimal performance."}
            HARDWARE INFORMATION: The machine running the dbms has a RAM of 31 GB, a CPU of 12 cores, and a 741 GB HDD drive.
            JSON RESULT TEMPLATE:
            {

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.

Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.

- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.
            </step>

            <example>
KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.

Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            SUGGESTION: {'suggestion': "For optimal performance of maintenance tasks in PostgreSQL, such as VACUUM and CREATE INDEX, configure the 'maintenance_work_mem' parameter with careful consideration. Start with the default setting of 64MB, but consider increasing it to leverage larger RAM resources, especially if your system handles extensive write operations. Be mindful that while larger settings can enhance performance, they also increase memory usage by autovacuum processes, which can allocate memory up to the 'autovacuum_max_workers' times this value. Additionally, note that VACUUM's dead tuple collection is limited to 1GB. Adjust this parameter based on your system's RAM and the complexity of maintenance operations to ensure efficient resource utilization."}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

Start with the default setting of 64MB, but consider increasing it to leverage larger RAM resources, especially if your system handles extensive write operations.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.

Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.

- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.

So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

            SUGGESTION: {'suggestion': "To optimize the 'wal_level' setting in PostgreSQL, which determines the extent of information logged to the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) system, choose 'minimal' for logging only crash recovery data, 'replica' to enable WAL archiving and replication, and 'logical' to support logical decoding. Each level includes all information from lower levels. This setting, adjustable only at server start, affects performance and data recovery capabilities, with 'minimal' producing the least WAL volume and 'logical' potentially increasing it, especially during numerous UPDATE and DELETE operations. Align these choices with PostgreSQL's version-specific defaults and capabilities to ensure optimal performance."}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

"min_value": null,

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.

SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.

For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            SUGGESTION: {'suggestion': "To optimize the 'random_page_cost' setting in PostgreSQL, which defaults to 4.0, adjust this value based on the actual caching conditions and the type of storage technology used. For solid-state drives (SSDs) with lower random read costs, consider decreasing it closer to 1.1, as SSDs have a faster random access profile. This adjustment reflects the planner's estimated cost of fetching a non-sequential disk page and should account for the assumption that 90% of random reads are cached. For traditional spinning disks, the value might remain closer to the default if performance permits."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

Database Management Systems (DBMS) have settings referred to as 'knobs'. Numerical knobs typically have a natural order. However, some 'special' numerical knobs have special values, such as -1 or 0, that break this natural order. When set to a special value, such knob performs a very different function compared to its regular operation, such as disabling a feature. Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob. Let us think step by step, please classify a knob of postgresas a 'special knob' and provide the RESULT in JSON format.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

            KNOB: synchronous_commit
            SUGGESTION: {'suggestion': "The 'synchronous_commit' setting in PostgreSQL is crucial for determining the level of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) completion required before the server acknowledges a transaction as successful to the client. To configure this setting, consider the trade-off between performance and durability. Setting it to 'off' can enhance performance but may lead to potential data loss in the event of a crash. The 'local' setting minimizes commit wait times on the local server, while 'remote_write' ensures commit waits only for WAL writes to remote servers. For full commit confirmation, use 'on', which requires both local and remote applications. For the highest durability, choose 'remote_apply', which ensures all changes are applied and visible on synchronous standbys, though this may result in larger delays. Adjust the setting based on your specific needs for performance and data safety."}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
