{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'autovacuum_work_mem' is a special knob, we first need to understand its function and possible values. 'autovacuum_work_mem' is used to set the memory available to the autovacuum worker processes in PostgreSQL. Typically, this would be a positive integer value representing the amount of memory in kilobytes. However, in PostgreSQL, certain numerical knobs have special values that change their behavior significantly, such as disabling the feature or using a default setting. For 'autovacuum_work_mem', setting it to -1 is a special value that tells PostgreSQL to use the setting of 'maintenance_work_mem' instead. This means that -1 is a special value that changes the behavior of the knob from its regular numerical operation.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
