{"think_procedure": "The 'wal_block_size' knob in PostgreSQL determines the block size for the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) system. Typically, this kind of setting would have a numerical value representing the size in bytes, and it would have a natural order, i.e., larger values mean larger block sizes. To determine if it's a special knob, we need to check if there are any values, such as -1 or 0, that cause the setting to behave differently, such as disabling the feature or switching to a default behavior. In PostgreSQL, 'wal_block_size' is a compile-time constant and does not have special values like -1 or 0 that alter its behavior. It is set at the time of database creation and cannot be changed without recompiling PostgreSQL. Therefore, it does not have special behavior triggered by specific numerical values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
