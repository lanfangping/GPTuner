{"think_procedure": "First, understand the purpose of the 'statement_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL. It sets the time limit in milliseconds for a query to execute. If a query exceeds this time, it is automatically canceled. Next, identify if there are any special values associated with this knob. In PostgreSQL, setting 'statement_timeout' to 0 disables the timeout feature, which is a significant deviation from its regular numerical behavior. This means that when set to 0, the knob does not function as a timeout but rather disables the timeout entirely. Therefore, 'statement_timeout' is a special knob because it has a special value (0) that alters its fundamental operation.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
