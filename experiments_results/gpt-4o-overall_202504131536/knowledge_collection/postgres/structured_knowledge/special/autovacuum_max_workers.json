{"think_procedure": "First, identify the purpose of the 'autovacuum_max_workers' knob in PostgreSQL. This knob determines the maximum number of autovacuum processes that can be run simultaneously. Next, determine if there are any special values that cause the knob to behave differently than its numerical order would suggest. In PostgreSQL, setting this knob to 0 disables autovacuuming entirely, which is a distinct function compared to its regular operation of controlling the number of workers. Therefore, this knob does have a special value that alters its behavior significantly.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
