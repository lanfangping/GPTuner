{"think_procedure": "First, identify the type of knob 'enable_indexonlyscan'. It is a boolean knob, meaning it only takes values true or false. Next, determine if it has any special numerical values that change its behavior beyond the regular true/false setting. Since it is a boolean knob, it does not have numerical values like -1 or 0 that would alter its function in a special way. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
