{"think_procedure": "First, identify the purpose of the 'block_size' knob in PostgreSQL. The 'block_size' defines the size of a disk block in the database, which is a critical parameter for performance tuning. Next, determine if 'block_size' has any special values that alter its function drastically, such as disabling a feature or changing its operational mode. Typically, 'block_size' is set to a specific size in bytes, like 8KB, and does not have special values like -1 or 0 that change its function. It is a straightforward numerical setting that does not exhibit behavior akin to a 'special knob'. Therefore, it does not have any special values that would classify it as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
