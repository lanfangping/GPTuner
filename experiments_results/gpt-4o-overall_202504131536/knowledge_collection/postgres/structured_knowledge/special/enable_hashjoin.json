{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_hashjoin' is a configuration setting in PostgreSQL that determines whether hash joins are enabled or not. It is a boolean setting rather than a numerical one, meaning it takes values 'on' or 'off'. Since it is not a numerical knob, it does not have a natural order or special numerical values like -1 or 0 that change its function. Instead, it simply toggles the feature on or off. Therefore, it cannot be classified as a 'special numerical knob' with special values that alter its behavior.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
