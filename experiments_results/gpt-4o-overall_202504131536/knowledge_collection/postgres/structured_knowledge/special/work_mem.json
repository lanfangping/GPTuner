{"think_procedure": "First, identify the purpose of the 'work_mem' knob in PostgreSQL. 'work_mem' is used to set the amount of memory to be used by internal sort operations and hash tables before writing to temporary disk files. Next, determine if there are any special values that alter its behavior beyond just setting a memory size. In PostgreSQL, 'work_mem' does not have any special values like -1 or 0 that change its function drastically, such as disabling a feature or enabling a special mode. It purely dictates the memory size for operations. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob without special values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
