{"think_procedure": "The 'wal_buffers' knob in PostgreSQL is used to set the amount of shared memory used for write-ahead logging (WAL) data. It is typically set to a positive integer value representing the number of disk page buffers. However, when 'wal_buffers' is set to -1, it has a special behavior: it automatically adjusts its size based on the size of the shared_buffers setting. This indicates that -1 is a special value that alters the natural order of this numerical knob, as it changes its behavior from a fixed size to an automatically determined size.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
