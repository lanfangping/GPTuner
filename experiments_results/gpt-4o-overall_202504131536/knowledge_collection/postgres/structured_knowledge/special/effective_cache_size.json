{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'effective_cache_size' is a special knob, we need to first understand its purpose and how it operates within PostgreSQL. 'effective_cache_size' is a configuration parameter that provides a rough estimate of the effective size of the disk cache available to a single query. It is used by the PostgreSQL query planner to help determine the most efficient way to execute a query. Typically, this value is set to a positive number representing the amount of memory in kilobytes. We need to check if there are any special values like -1 or 0 that would cause the knob to behave differently, such as disabling a feature or altering its function. Upon reviewing the documentation and common practices, 'effective_cache_size' does not have special values like -1 or 0 that change its function. It purely acts as a numerical knob reflecting the cache size estimation. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of having special values that alter its behavior significantly.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
