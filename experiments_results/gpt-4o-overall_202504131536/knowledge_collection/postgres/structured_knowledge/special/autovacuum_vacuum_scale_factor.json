{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL is used to determine when an autovacuum operation should start based on the fraction of the table that has been updated or deleted. Typically, this knob is set to a positive decimal value, for example, 0.2, meaning autovacuum will trigger when 20% of the table has been modified. The knob does not have a special value like -1 or 0 that changes its fundamental behavior, such as disabling the feature or altering its operation drastically. It operates within a range of positive decimal values, and there is no indication in the documentation or common usage that it has a distinct special value that changes its nature significantly. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as a 'special knob' with a special value.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
