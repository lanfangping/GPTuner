{"think_procedure": "First, identify if the knob 'max_worker_processes' has a special value that alters its behavior significantly. In PostgreSQL, a special value usually means that setting the knob to this value will enable or disable a feature, rather than adjusting it incrementally. For 'max_worker_processes', examine the documentation to see if any value like -1 or 0 is mentioned as having a unique effect. If such a value exists, it is a special knob. Otherwise, it is a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
