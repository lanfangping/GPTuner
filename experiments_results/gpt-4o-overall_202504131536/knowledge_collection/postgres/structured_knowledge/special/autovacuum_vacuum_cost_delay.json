{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' in PostgreSQL is used to set the delay in milliseconds between each action performed by the autovacuum process. This knob typically takes a positive numerical value, which represents the delay in milliseconds. However, according to PostgreSQL documentation, setting this knob to a value of -1 has a special meaning: it disables the autovacuum cost delay, meaning no delay is introduced between actions. This special value of -1 breaks the natural order of the knob's numerical values, as it changes the knob's behavior entirely from introducing a delay to having no delay at all. Therefore, this knob can be classified as a 'special knob' because it has a special value that changes its fundamental operation.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
