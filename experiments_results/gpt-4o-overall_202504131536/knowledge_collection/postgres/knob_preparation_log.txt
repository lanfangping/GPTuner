                Summerize the description for knob 'work_mem' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the base maximum amount of memory to be used by a query operation (such as a sort or hash table) before writing to temporary disk files. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as kilobytes. The default value is four megabytes (4MB). Note that a complex query might perform several sort and hash operations at the same time, with each operation generally being allowed to use as much memory as this value specifies before it starts to write data into temporary files. Also, several running sessions could be doing such operations concurrently. Therefore, the total memory used could be many times the value of work_mem; it is necessary to keep this fact in mind when choosing the value. Sort operations are used for ORDER BY, DISTINCT, and merge joins. Hash tables are used in hash joins, hash-based aggregation, and hash-based processing of IN subqueries.
Hash-based operations are generally more sensitive to memory availability than equivalent sort-based operations. The memory limit for a hash table is computed by multiplying work_mem by hash_mem_multiplier. This makes it possible for hash-based operations to use an amount of memory that exceeds the usual work_mem base amount.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:
 {'boot_val': '4096', 'category': 'Resource Usage / Memory', 'context': 'user', 'enumvals': None, 'extra_desc': 'This much memory can be used by each internal sort operation and hash table before switching to temporary disk files.', 'max_val': '2147483647', 'min_val': '64', 'name': 'work_mem', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': '4096', 'setting': '4096', 'short_desc': 'Sets the maximum memory to be used for query workspaces.', 'source': 'configuration file', 'sourcefile': '/var/lib/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.auto.conf', 'sourceline': 19, 'unit': 'kB', 'vartype': 'integer'}
 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the `work_mem` value in PostgreSQL, consider allocating about 25% of the available memory for queries, and if you run multiple concurrent operations, it is generally advised to start with a value between 4MB to 64MB per session, adjusting based on query complexity and system workload.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Setting this parameter requires inspecting the memory usage in your queries. If this value falls short in a query execution, the engine will use memory and disk, impacting on its performance. Although, keeping this value too large, could destabilize the node throughput when dealing with too many concurrent operations. For OLTP queries that do not require complex joins or sorting lots of data, this value may be in the low MBs. For OLAP-style queries, and few concurrent queries, it may grow into the GB range. Multiply by max_connections * N (being N a small single-digit number) to estimate the maximum amount of total memory potential consumed by Postgres process. Adjust based on it. If possible, raise the default value.The default value for work_mem is 4MB. This is generally acknowledged to be too small for most modern systems. For example, Christophe Pettus suggests that 16MB is a good starting point for most people. So it’s pretty normal to at least consider increasing it. work_mem = <1-5% of RAM>

 Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format.:

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.

 The "checkpoint_timeout" knob in PostgreSQL should generally be set between 5 to 30 minutes, with 10 minutes often being a practical default, balancing between too frequent checkpoints that can lead to performance overhead and too infrequent ones that may prolong recovery time after a crash.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Normally you want to raise it (e.g. ‘15min’). The larger the parameter is, you may experience larger I/O spikes (which may be smoothed out tuning checkpoint_completion_target and bgwriter activity) and the larger recovery time you may experience after a database crash. However, more frequent checkpoints create in aggregation more I/O, so raising it typically improves I/O usage.

 Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format.:

Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

                Summerize the description for knob 'lock_timeout' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Abort any statement that waits longer than the specified amount of time while attempting to acquire a lock on a table, index, row, or other database object. The time limit applies separately to each lock acquisition attempt. The limit applies both to explicit locking requests (such as LOCK TABLE, or SELECT FOR UPDATE without NOWAIT) and to implicitly-acquired locks. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. A value of zero (the default) disables the timeout.
Unlike statement_timeout, this timeout can only occur while waiting for locks. Note that if statement_timeout is nonzero, it is rather pointless to set lock_timeout to the same or larger value, since the statement timeout would always trigger first. If log_min_error_statement is set to ERROR or lower, the statement that timed out will be logged.
Setting lock_timeout in postgresql.conf is not recommended because it would affect all sessions.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the 'lock_timeout' in Postgres, choose a value based on the duration you are willing to wait for a lock to be acquired, typically a few seconds (e.g., 2,000 milliseconds) to avoid long waits while balancing application requirements; ensure to test and adjust according to your specific workload and performance needs.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value for 'autovacuum_max_workers' in PostgreSQL, consider starting with a value of 2-3 for small systems and increasing to 5-10 for larger systems with high transaction volumes, ensuring balance between vacuuming efficiency and system resources.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Raise it to smooth I/O activity of checkpoints over larger periods of time. If you rely on this value for feeding non-streaming replicas, it is recommended to keep this within a low percentage. On development instances, it is usual to set it to ‘0.9’.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Method used for forcing WAL updates out to disk. If fsync is off then this setting is irrelevant, since WAL file updates will not be forced out at all. Possible values are:
open_datasync (write WAL files with open() option O_DSYNC)
fdatasync (call fdatasync() at each commit)
fsync (call fsync() at each commit)
fsync_writethrough (call fsync() at each commit, forcing write-through of any disk write cache)
open_sync (write WAL files with open() option O_SYNC)
The open_* options also use O_DIRECT if available. Not all of these choices are available on all platforms. The default is the first method in the above list that is supported by the platform, except that fdatasync is the default on Linux and FreeBSD. The default is not necessarily ideal; it might be necessary to change this setting or other aspects of your system configuration in order to create a crash-safe configuration or achieve optimal performance. These aspects are discussed in Section 29.1. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

Summerize the description for knob 'effective_cache_size' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Sets the planner's assumption about the effective size of the disk cache that is available to a single query. This is factored into estimates of the cost of using an index; a higher value makes it more likely index scans will be used, a lower value makes it more likely sequential scans will be used. When setting this parameter you should consider both PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the portion of the kernel's disk cache that will be used for PostgreSQL data files, though some data might exist in both places. Also, take into account the expected number of concurrent queries on different tables, since they will have to share the available space. This parameter has no effect on the size of shared memory allocated by PostgreSQL, nor does it reserve kernel disk cache; it is used only for estimation purposes. The system also does not assume data remains in the disk cache between queries. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. The default is 4 gigabytes (4GB). (If BLCKSZ is not 8kB, the default value scales proportionally to it.)

Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

If there is contradictory information between certain suggestions, especially the contradictions of values, keep the information provided by the higher-priority suggestion and only remove the contradictory information provided by the lower-priority suggestion. Do not remove the other information. The priority is defined in sequence as "manual_suggestion, web_suggestion, gpt_suggestion" from higher to lower. So manual_suggestion should not be changed.

THREE SUGGESTIONS:

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.

Summerize the description for knob 'checkpoint_flush_after' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Whenever more than this amount of data has been written while performing a checkpoint, attempt to force the OS to issue these writes to the underlying storage. Doing so will limit the amount of dirty data in the kernel's page cache, reducing the likelihood of stalls when an fsync is issued at the end of the checkpoint, or when the OS writes data back in larger batches in the background. Often that will result in greatly reduced transaction latency, but there also are some cases, especially with workloads that are bigger than shared_buffers, but smaller than the OS's page cache, where performance might degrade. This setting may have no effect on some platforms. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. The valid range is between 0, which disables forced writeback, and 2MB. The default is 256kB on Linux, 0 elsewhere. (If BLCKSZ is not 8kB, the default and maximum values scale proportionally to it.) This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the maximum number of workers that can be started by a single Gather or Gather Merge node. Parallel workers are taken from the pool of processes established by max_worker_processes, limited by max_parallel_workers. Note that the requested number of workers may not actually be available at run time. If this occurs, the plan will run with fewer workers than expected, which may be inefficient. The default value is 2. Setting this value to 0 disables parallel query execution.
Note that parallel queries may consume very substantially more resources than non-parallel queries, because each worker process is a completely separate process which has roughly the same impact on the system as an additional user session. This should be taken into account when choosing a value for this setting, as well as when configuring other settings that control resource utilization, such as work_mem. Resource limits such as work_mem are applied individually to each worker, which means the total utilization may be much higher across all processes than it would normally be for any single process. For example, a parallel query using 4 workers may use up to 5 times as much CPU time, memory, I/O bandwidth, and so forth as a query which uses no workers at all.
For more information on parallel query, see Chapter 15.

If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:
 {'boot_val': '2', 'category': 'Resource Usage / Asynchronous Behavior', 'context': 'user', 'enumvals': None, 'extra_desc': None, 'max_val': '1024', 'min_val': '0', 'name': 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': '2', 'setting': '2', 'short_desc': 'Sets the maximum number of parallel processes per executor node.', 'source': 'default', 'sourcefile': None, 'sourceline': None, 'unit': None, 'vartype': 'integer'}
 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 The recommended value for the `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` knob in PostgreSQL is typically around 2 to 4, but it should be set based on your workload and hardware capabilities, ensuring it does not exceed the number of CPU cores available minus one to maintain system performance balance.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Beware of setting to a high value for high throughput OLTP systems. Oftentimes it is better to leave it on 1 or 2 at most. Raise it for analytical/DW systems, always to a fraction of cores. This parameter is affected by work_mem, we recommend to review that value accordingly.

 Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format.:
 {
     "gpt_suggestion": null ,   // if there is a contradiction, remove the contradictory part, else return the corresponding original suggestion.
     "web_suggestion": null   // if there is a contradiction, remove the contradictory part, else return the corresponding original suggestion.

Summerize the description for knob 'bgwriter_lru_multiplier' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
The number of dirty buffers written in each round is based on the number of new buffers that have been needed by server processes during recent rounds. The average recent need is multiplied by bgwriter_lru_multiplier to arrive at an estimate of the number of buffers that will be needed during the next round. Dirty buffers are written until there are that many clean, reusable buffers available. (However, no more than bgwriter_lru_maxpages buffers will be written per round.) Thus, a setting of 1.0 represents a “just in time” policy of writing exactly the number of buffers predicted to be needed. Larger values provide some cushion against spikes in demand, while smaller values intentionally leave writes to be done by server processes. The default is 2.0. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

DESCRIPTION:
In each round, no more than this many buffers will be written by the background writer. Setting this to zero disables background writing. (Note that checkpoints, which are managed by a separate, dedicated auxiliary process, are unaffected.) The default value is 100 buffers. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

                DESCRIPTION:
                If this parameter is on, the PostgreSQL server will try to make sure that updates are physically written to disk, by issuing fsync() system calls or various equivalent methods (see wal_sync_method). This ensures that the database cluster can recover to a consistent state after an operating system or hardware crash.
While turning off fsync is often a performance benefit, this can result in unrecoverable data corruption in the event of a power failure or system crash. Thus it is only advisable to turn off fsync if you can easily recreate your entire database from external data.
Examples of safe circumstances for turning off fsync include the initial loading of a new database cluster from a backup file, using a database cluster for processing a batch of data after which the database will be thrown away and recreated, or for a read-only database clone which gets recreated frequently and is not used for failover. High quality hardware alone is not a sufficient justification for turning off fsync.
For reliable recovery when changing fsync off to on, it is necessary to force all modified buffers in the kernel to durable storage. This can be done while the cluster is shutdown or while fsync is on by running initdb --sync-only, running sync, unmounting the file system, or rebooting the server.
In many situations, turning off synchronous_commit for noncritical transactions can provide much of the potential performance benefit of turning off fsync, without the attendant risks of data corruption.
fsync can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. If you turn this parameter off, also consider turning off full_page_writes.

DESCRIPTION:
Specifies a fraction of the table size to add to autovacuum_vacuum_threshold when deciding whether to trigger a VACUUM. The default is 0.2 (20% of table size). This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value for 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, start by using a typical default of 0.2, which means 20% of table rows need to change before an autovacuum is triggered, and adjust based on workload and table size; for large, frequently updated tables, consider reducing it to 0.05 or lower to ensure timely vacuum operations, while for smaller, less active tables, a higher setting might suffice.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

DESCRIPTION:
Write a message to the server log if checkpoints caused by the filling of WAL segment files happen closer together than this amount of time (which suggests that max_wal_size ought to be raised). If this value is specified without units, it is taken as seconds. The default is 30 seconds (30s). Zero disables the warning. No warnings will be generated if checkpoint_timeout is less than checkpoint_warning. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".

 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 This alerts you in the logs if checkpoints are happening too often. Set it to a fraction of checkpoint_timeout (e.g. ‘5min’) or ‘1min’ if checkpoint_timeout is not tuned.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.

Summerize the description for knob 'min_wal_size' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
As long as WAL disk usage stays below this setting, old WAL files are always recycled for future use at a checkpoint, rather than removed. This can be used to ensure that enough WAL space is reserved to handle spikes in WAL usage, for example when running large batch jobs. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as megabytes. The default is 80 MB. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies the maximum amount of memory to be used by each autovacuum worker process. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as kilobytes. It defaults to -1, indicating that the value of maintenance_work_mem should be used instead. The setting has no effect on the behavior of VACUUM when run in other contexts. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.
For the collection of dead tuple identifiers, autovacuum is only able to utilize up to a maximum of 1GB of memory, so setting autovacuum_work_mem to a value higher than that has no effect on the number of dead tuples that autovacuum can collect while scanning a table.

Summerize the description for knob 'wal_writer_delay' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Specifies how often the WAL writer flushes WAL, in time terms. After flushing WAL the writer sleeps for the length of time given by wal_writer_delay, unless woken up sooner by an asynchronously committing transaction. If the last flush happened less than wal_writer_delay ago and less than wal_writer_flush_after worth of WAL has been produced since, then WAL is only written to the operating system, not flushed to disk. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. The default value is 200 milliseconds (200ms). Note that on many systems, the effective resolution of sleep delays is 10 milliseconds; setting wal_writer_delay to a value that is not a multiple of 10 might have the same results as setting it to the next higher multiple of 10. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the 'checkpoint_completion_target' in PostgreSQL, a value between 0.5 and 0.9 is recommended, adjusting closer to 0.9 to spread checkpoint I/O more evenly and reduce performance spikes during periods of high database activity.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Raise it to smooth I/O activity of checkpoints over larger periods of time. If you rely on this value for feeding non-streaming replicas, it is recommended to keep this within a low percentage. On development instances, it is usual to set it to ‘0.9’.

 Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format.:

Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".

                Summerize the description for knob 'full_page_writes' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                When this parameter is on, the PostgreSQL server writes the entire content of each disk page to WAL during the first modification of that page after a checkpoint. This is needed because a page write that is in process during an operating system crash might be only partially completed, leading to an on-disk page that contains a mix of old and new data. The row-level change data normally stored in WAL will not be enough to completely restore such a page during post-crash recovery. Storing the full page image guarantees that the page can be correctly restored, but at the price of increasing the amount of data that must be written to WAL. (Because WAL replay always starts from a checkpoint, it is sufficient to do this during the first change of each page after a checkpoint. Therefore, one way to reduce the cost of full-page writes is to increase the checkpoint interval parameters.)
Turning this parameter off speeds normal operation, but might lead to either unrecoverable data corruption, or silent data corruption, after a system failure. The risks are similar to turning off fsync, though smaller, and it should be turned off only based on the same circumstances recommended for that parameter.
Turning off this parameter does not affect use of WAL archiving for point-in-time recovery (PITR) (see Section 25.3).
This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. The default is on.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

Summerize the description for knob 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Specifies the minimum number of inserted, updated or deleted tuples needed to trigger an ANALYZE in any one table. The default is 50 tuples. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

DESCRIPTION:
Specifies the number of inserted tuples needed to trigger a VACUUM in any one table. The default is 1000 tuples. If -1 is specified, autovacuum will not trigger a VACUUM operation on any tables based on the number of inserts. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.

If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

                DESCRIPTION:
                The amount of shared memory used for WAL data that has not yet been written to disk. The default setting of -1 selects a size equal to 1/32nd (about 3%) of shared_buffers, but not less than 64kB nor more than the size of one WAL segment, typically 16MB. This value can be set manually if the automatic choice is too large or too small, but any positive value less than 32kB will be treated as 32kB. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as WAL blocks, that is XLOG_BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. This parameter can only be set at server start.
The contents of the WAL buffers are written out to disk at every transaction commit, so extremely large values are unlikely to provide a significant benefit. However, setting this value to at least a few megabytes can improve write performance on a busy server where many clients are committing at once. The auto-tuning selected by the default setting of -1 should give reasonable results in most cases.

If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies the maximum amount of memory to be used by maintenance operations, such as VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as kilobytes. It defaults to 64 megabytes (64MB). Since only one of these operations can be executed at a time by a database session, and an installation normally doesn't have many of them running concurrently, it's safe to set this value significantly larger than work_mem. Larger settings might improve performance for vacuuming and for restoring database dumps.
Note that when autovacuum runs, up to autovacuum_max_workers times this memory may be allocated, so be careful not to set the default value too high. It may be useful to control for this by separately setting autovacuum_work_mem.
Note that for the collection of dead tuple identifiers, VACUUM is only able to utilize up to a maximum of 1GB of memory.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.

Summerize the description for knob 'max_parallel_workers' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Sets the maximum number of workers that the system can support for parallel operations. The default value is 8. When increasing or decreasing this value, consider also adjusting max_parallel_maintenance_workers and max_parallel_workers_per_gather. Also, note that a setting for this value which is higher than max_worker_processes will have no effect, since parallel workers are taken from the pool of worker processes established by that setting.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value for 'max_parallel_workers' in PostgreSQL, it is generally recommended to align it with the number of CPU cores available, typically starting from 2 to 4 for moderate workloads and adjusting upwards based on system capabilities and workload characteristics, while considering that values beyond the number of CPU cores could lead to diminishing returns or increased contention.

 Adjust it accordingly to max_parallel_workers_per_gather (which is limited by this parameter).

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that PostgreSQL expects can be executed simultaneously. Raising this value will increase the number of I/O operations that any individual PostgreSQL session attempts to initiate in parallel. The allowed range is 1 to 1000, or zero to disable issuance of asynchronous I/O requests. Currently, this setting only affects bitmap heap scans.
For magnetic drives, a good starting point for this setting is the number of separate drives comprising a RAID 0 stripe or RAID 1 mirror being used for the database. (For RAID 5 the parity drive should not be counted.) However, if the database is often busy with multiple queries issued in concurrent sessions, lower values may be sufficient to keep the disk array busy. A value higher than needed to keep the disks busy will only result in extra CPU overhead. SSDs and other memory-based storage can often process many concurrent requests, so the best value might be in the hundreds.
Asynchronous I/O depends on an effective posix_fadvise function, which some operating systems lack. If the function is not present then setting this parameter to anything but zero will result in an error. On some operating systems (e.g., Solaris), the function is present but does not actually do anything.
The default is 1 on supported systems, otherwise 0. This value can be overridden for tables in a particular tablespace by setting the tablespace parameter of the same name (see ALTER TABLESPACE).

                DESCRIPTION:
                The planner will rewrite explicit JOIN constructs (except FULL JOINs) into lists of FROM items whenever a list of no more than this many items would result. Smaller values reduce planning time but might yield inferior query plans.
By default, this variable is set the same as from_collapse_limit, which is appropriate for most uses. Setting it to 1 prevents any reordering of explicit JOINs. Thus, the explicit join order specified in the query will be the actual order in which the relations are joined. Because the query planner does not always choose the optimal join order, advanced users can elect to temporarily set this variable to 1, and then specify the join order they desire explicitly. For more information see Section 14.3.
Setting this value to geqo_threshold or more may trigger use of the GEQO planner, resulting in non-optimal plans. See Section 19.7.3.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 The value for the 'join_collapse_limit' knob in PostgreSQL should be set based on the complexity of your queries, with a lower number like 8 or 10 used to limit the planner's effort in considering multiple join permutations, which can help improve performance on simpler queries, while higher values or even the default (12) can be used if your workload involves complex queries with many joins where exhaustive planning is beneficial.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value for the 'enable_indexscan' knob in PostgreSQL, you can use the SQL command `SET enable_indexscan TO {on|off}`; setting it to `on` (default) enables the planner to consider using index scans, while setting it to `off` (by using `SET enable_indexscan TO off`) forces the database to ignore index scans, which can be useful for testing performance behavior without indexes.

                DESCRIPTION:
                wal_level determines how much information is written to the WAL. The default value is replica, which writes enough data to support WAL archiving and replication, including running read-only queries on a standby server. minimal removes all logging except the information required to recover from a crash or immediate shutdown. Finally, logical adds information necessary to support logical decoding. Each level includes the information logged at all lower levels. This parameter can only be set at server start.
The minimal level generates the least WAL volume. It logs no row information for permanent relations in transactions that create or rewrite them. This can make operations much faster (see Section 14.4.7). Operations that initiate this optimization include:
But minimal WAL does not contain enough information to reconstruct the data from a base backup and the WAL logs, so replica or higher must be used to enable WAL archiving (archive_mode) and streaming replication.
In logical level, the same information is logged as with replica, plus information needed to allow extracting logical change sets from the WAL. Using a level of logical will increase the WAL volume, particularly if many tables are configured for REPLICA IDENTITY FULL and many UPDATE and DELETE statements are executed.
In releases prior to 9.6, this parameter also allowed the values archive and hot_standby. These are still accepted but mapped to replica.

If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

OFFICIAL_DOC:
{'boot_val': 'replica', 'category': 'Write-Ahead Log / Settings', 'context': 'postmaster', 'enumvals': ['minimal', 'replica', 'logical'], 'extra_desc': None, 'max_val': None, 'min_val': None, 'name': 'wal_level', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': 'replica', 'setting': 'replica', 'short_desc': 'Sets the level of information written to the WAL.', 'source': 'default', 'sourcefile': None, 'sourceline': None, 'unit': None, 'vartype': 'enum'}
THREE SUGGESTIONS:
{'gpt_suggestion': "For optimal tuning of the 'wal_level' knob in PostgreSQL, set it to 'replica' for streaming replication setups, 'logical' for using logical replication or decoding, and retain 'minimal' if neither replication nor standby servers are required, ensuring to align these choices with PostgreSQL's version-specific defaults and capabilities.", 'web_suggestion': None, 'manual_suggestion': 'The `wal_level` parameter determines the extent of information logged to the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) in PostgreSQL, with options including `minimal` (logging only crash recovery data), `replica` (enabling WAL archiving and replication), and `logical` (supporting logical decoding), with each level encompassing all information from lower levels; note that this setting, adjustable only at server start, affects performance and data recovery capabilities, where `minimal` results in the least WAL volume and `logical` potentially increases it when handling many UPDATE and DELETE operations.'}

Now let's think step by step and give me the result in legal json format:
    {
        "gpt_suggestion": null ,   // if the original suggestion is empty, return null, else return the corresponding answer.
        "web_suggestion": null,  // if the original suggestion is empty, return null, else return the corresponding answer.

                Summerize the description for knob 'statement_timeout' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Abort any statement that takes more than the specified amount of time. If log_min_error_statement is set to ERROR or lower, the statement that timed out will also be logged. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. A value of zero (the default) disables the timeout.
The timeout is measured from the time a command arrives at the server until it is completed by the server. If multiple SQL statements appear in a single simple-Query message, the timeout is applied to each statement separately. (PostgreSQL versions before 13 usually treated the timeout as applying to the whole query string.) In extended query protocol, the timeout starts running when any query-related message (Parse, Bind, Execute, Describe) arrives, and it is canceled by completion of an Execute or Sync message.
Setting statement_timeout in postgresql.conf is not recommended because it would affect all sessions.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.

                Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections from standby servers or streaming base backup clients (i.e., the maximum number of simultaneously running WAL sender processes). The default is 10. The value 0 means replication is disabled. Abrupt disconnection of a streaming client might leave an orphaned connection slot behind until a timeout is reached, so this parameter should be set slightly higher than the maximum number of expected clients so disconnected clients can immediately reconnect. This parameter can only be set at server start. Also, wal_level must be set to replica or higher to allow connections from standby servers.
When running a standby server, you must set this parameter to the same or higher value than on the master server. Otherwise, queries will not be allowed in the standby server.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

                Summerize the description for knob 'shared_buffers' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers. The default is typically 128 megabytes (128MB), but might be less if your kernel settings will not support it (as determined during initdb). This setting must be at least 128 kilobytes. However, settings significantly higher than the minimum are usually needed for good performance. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. (Non-default values of BLCKSZ change the minimum value.) This parameter can only be set at server start.
If you have a dedicated database server with 1GB or more of RAM, a reasonable starting value for shared_buffers is 25% of the memory in your system. There are some workloads where even larger settings for shared_buffers are effective, but because PostgreSQL also relies on the operating system cache, it is unlikely that an allocation of more than 40% of RAM to shared_buffers will work better than a smaller amount. Larger settings for shared_buffers usually require a corresponding increase in max_wal_size, in order to spread out the process of writing large quantities of new or changed data over a longer period of time.
On systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage of RAM is appropriate, so as to leave adequate space for the operating system.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the `shared_buffers` value in PostgreSQL, it is typically recommended to allocate 25% of the total system RAM, but not to exceed 8GB for most systems, as allocating too much can lead to diminished returns in performance due to increased management overhead.

 Conventional wisdom suggests 25% of the RAM. Do your own benchmarks varying this parameter. If you are into hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. Adjust accordingly for non-dedicated servers, considering that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations.

                Summerize the description for knob 'random_page_cost' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the planner's estimate of the cost of a non-sequentially-fetched disk page. The default is 4.0. This value can be overridden for tables and indexes in a particular tablespace by setting the tablespace parameter of the same name (see ALTER TABLESPACE).
Reducing this value relative to seq_page_cost will cause the system to prefer index scans; raising it will make index scans look relatively more expensive. You can raise or lower both values together to change the importance of disk I/O costs relative to CPU costs, which are described by the following parameters.
Random access to mechanical disk storage is normally much more expensive than four times sequential access. However, a lower default is used (4.0) because the majority of random accesses to disk, such as indexed reads, are assumed to be in cache. The default value can be thought of as modeling random access as 40 times slower than sequential, while expecting 90% of random reads to be cached.
If you believe a 90% cache rate is an incorrect assumption for your workload, you can increase random_page_cost to better reflect the true cost of random storage reads. Correspondingly, if your data is likely to be completely in cache, such as when the database is smaller than the total server memory, decreasing random_page_cost can be appropriate. Storage that has a low random read cost relative to sequential, e.g., solid-state drives, might also be better modeled with a lower value for random_page_cost, e.g., 1.1.
Although the system will let you set random_page_cost to less than seq_page_cost, it is not physically sensible to do so. However, setting them equal makes sense if the database is entirely cached in RAM, since in that case there is no penalty for touching pages out of sequence. Also, in a heavily-cached database you should lower both values relative to the CPU parameters, since the cost of fetching a page already in RAM is much smaller than it would normally be.

DESCRIPTION:
Specifies a fraction of the table size to add to autovacuum_analyze_threshold when deciding whether to trigger an ANALYZE. The default is 0.1 (10% of table size). This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value for the 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, consider adjusting it based on your update activity, typically starting with a lower value such as 0.05 for more frequent analyze operations in highly active tables, while a higher default of 0.1 could be sufficient for tables with less frequent updates.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Unless there are disk space constraints, raise this value to make sure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. Increasing this value increases the recovery time after a database crash.

                Summerize the description for knob 'synchronous_commit' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies how much WAL processing must complete before the database server returns a “success” indication to the client. Valid values are remote_apply, on (the default), remote_write, local, and off.
If synchronous_standby_names is empty, the only meaningful settings are on and off; remote_apply, remote_write and local all provide the same local synchronization level as on. The local behavior of all non-off modes is to wait for local flush of WAL to disk. In off mode, there is no waiting, so there can be a delay between when success is reported to the client and when the transaction is later guaranteed to be safe against a server crash. (The maximum delay is three times wal_writer_delay.) Unlike fsync, setting this parameter to off does not create any risk of database inconsistency: an operating system or database crash might result in some recent allegedly-committed transactions being lost, but the database state will be just the same as if those transactions had been aborted cleanly. So, turning synchronous_commit off can be a useful alternative when performance is more important than exact certainty about the durability of a transaction. For more discussion see Section 29.3.
If synchronous_standby_names is non-empty, synchronous_commit also controls whether transaction commits will wait for their WAL records to be processed on the standby server(s).
When set to remote_apply, commits will wait until replies from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received the commit record of the transaction and applied it, so that it has become visible to queries on the standby(s), and also written to durable storage on the standbys. This will cause much larger commit delays than previous settings since it waits for WAL replay. When set to on, commits wait until replies from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received the commit record of the transaction and flushed it to durable storage. This ensures the transaction will not be lost unless both the primary and all synchronous standbys suffer corruption of their database storage. When set to remote_write, commits will wait until replies from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received the commit record of the transaction and written it to their file systems. This setting ensures data preservation if a standby instance of PostgreSQL crashes, but not if the standby suffers an operating-system-level crash because the data has not necessarily reached durable storage on the standby. The setting local causes commits to wait for local flush to disk, but not for replication. This is usually not desirable when synchronous replication is in use, but is provided for completeness.
This parameter can be changed at any time; the behavior for any one transaction is determined by the setting in effect when it commits. It is therefore possible, and useful, to have some transactions commit synchronously and others asynchronously. For example, to make a single multistatement transaction commit asynchronously when the default is the opposite, issue SET LOCAL synchronous_commit TO OFF within the transaction.
Table 19.1 summarizes the capabilities of the synchronous_commit settings.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value for the 'synchronous_commit' knob in PostgreSQL, consider the desired balance between performance and durability: set it to 'off' for maximum performance with potential risk of recent transaction loss during a crash, 'local' for minimizing commit wait times on the local server, 'remote_write' for ensuring commit waits only for WAL writes to remote servers, 'on' for full commit confirmation after both local and remote applies, or 'remote_apply' to ensure even higher durability at the cost of performance with all changes applied on remote systems before confirmation.

 None
