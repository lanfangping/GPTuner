To set the `autovacuum_naptime` value in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on the desired frequency of autovacuum runs, typically between **1 second (for aggressive cleanup)** and **1 minute (default, balancing load)**—e.g., `autovacuum_naptime = 30s` for a moderate interval—while ensuring it aligns with your workload’s tolerance for maintenance delays and I/O overhead.
