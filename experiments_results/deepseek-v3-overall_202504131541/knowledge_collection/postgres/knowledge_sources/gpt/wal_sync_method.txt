For the `wal_sync_method` knob in PostgreSQL, set it to `fdatasync` (default on most systems) unless benchmarking shows better performance with alternatives like `fsync`, `open_sync`, or `open_datasync`, where `fdatasync` typically achieves 5,000â€“15,000 transactions per second (TPS), while `open_sync` may reach 20,000+ TPS but risks data corruption on power loss. Choose based on durability and performance trade-offs.
