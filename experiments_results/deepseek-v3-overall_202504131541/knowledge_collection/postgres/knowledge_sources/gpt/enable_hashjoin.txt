To set the `enable_hashjoin` knob in PostgreSQL, typically enable it (`on` or `true`) for queries benefiting from hash joins (e.g., large table joins with equality conditions) or disable it (`off` or `false`) to force alternative plans (e.g., nested loops for small tables or merge joins for sorted data), with benchmarking to confirm performance gains (e.g., `SET enable_hashjoin = on;` for a 20% speedup in a specific workload).
