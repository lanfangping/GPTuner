To set the `checkpoint_timeout` knob in PostgreSQL, a common recommendation is to configure it between **5 minutes (300s)** and **30 minutes (1800s)**, balancing between recovery time (shorter timeouts) and write performance (longer timeouts), with the default being **5 minutes (300s)**; adjust based on workload and storage I/O capacity, ensuring it aligns with `max_wal_size` to avoid excessive checkpoint spikes.
