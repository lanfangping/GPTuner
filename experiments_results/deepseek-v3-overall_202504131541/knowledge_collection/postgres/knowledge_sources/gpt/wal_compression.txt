To set the `wal_compression` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (`on`) for high-write workloads to reduce WAL volume (typically achieving 20-40% compression with `lz4`, 30-50% with `zstd`, but with slight CPU overhead), or disable it (`off`) if CPU usage is a concern and I/O isn't a bottleneck. Choose `zstd` (PostgreSQL 14+) for the best compression ratio or `lz4` for minimal CPU impact.
