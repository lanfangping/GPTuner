To set the `shared_buffers` knob in PostgreSQL, a common recommendation is to allocate **25% of available RAM** (but not exceeding 8GB) for dedicated systems, e.g., **8GB on a 32GB RAM server**, while smaller systems (e.g., 4GB RAM) may use **1GB (25%)** or adjust downward if other services compete for memory. Always leave sufficient RAM for filesystem caching and other PostgreSQL workloads.
