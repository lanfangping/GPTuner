To set `enable_nestloop` in PostgreSQL, disable it (`enable_nestloop = off`) for large joins (e.g., tables with >10,000 rows) to favor hash/merge joins, but enable it (`enable_nestloop = on`) for small, indexed lookups (e.g., OLTP queries with <100 rows) to leverage efficient nested loop plans. Adjust based on query planner testing.
