To set the `wal_level` knob in PostgreSQL, choose between `minimal` (default, no replication), `replica` (for physical replication and logical decoding), or `logical` (for logical replication), with `replica` being the typical choice for most replication setups, requiring a server restart (`pg_ctl restart`) to apply the change.
