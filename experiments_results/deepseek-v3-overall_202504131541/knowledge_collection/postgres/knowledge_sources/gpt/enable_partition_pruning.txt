To set the `enable_partition_pruning` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (`on` or `true`) for most workloads to improve query performance on partitioned tables (typically reducing execution time by 20-50%), but disable it (`off` or `false`) only for debugging or edge cases where pruning causes issues.  

*(Default: `on` in PostgreSQL 11+; earlier versions may default to `off`.)*
