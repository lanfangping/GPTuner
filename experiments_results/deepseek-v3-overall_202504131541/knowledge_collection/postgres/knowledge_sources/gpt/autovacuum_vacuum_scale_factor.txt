To set `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor`, a typical starting value is **0.2** (20% of table size), but adjust it lower (e.g., **0.05** or 5%) for large tables to ensure more frequent vacuums or higher (e.g., **0.5**) for small, low-churn tables to reduce overhead. Monitor table bloat and workload to fine-tune.  

*(Note: The exact value depends on table size, update frequency, and performance requirements.)*
