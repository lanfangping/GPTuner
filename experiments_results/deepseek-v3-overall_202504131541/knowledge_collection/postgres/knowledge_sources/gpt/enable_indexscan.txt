To set the `enable_indexscan` knob in PostgreSQL, typically leave it `on` (default) for most workloads, but disable it (`off`) if sequential scans are faster for queries retrieving over ~30% of a table's rows or when indexes are poorly selective.  

(Note: The 30% threshold is a common heuristic, but the exact value depends on your data distribution and query patternsâ€”benchmark specific queries to confirm.)
