To set the `transaction_isolation` knob in PostgreSQL, choose one of the four levels—`read uncommitted` (rarely used due to PostgreSQL's MVCC), `read committed` (default, balances consistency and performance), `repeatable read` (prevents non-repeatable reads), or `serializable` (strictest, ensures full isolation but may impact throughput)—via `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL <value>` or in `postgresql.conf` (e.g., `default_transaction_isolation = 'read committed'`).
