To set the `log_autovacuum_min_duration` knob in PostgreSQL, configure it to log autovacuum operations that exceed a specific threshold (e.g., `500ms` for debugging or `1000ms` for production) by assigning a value like `log_autovacuum_min_duration = 500` (milliseconds) in `postgresql.conf`, where `0` logs all autovacuum activity and `-1` disables logging entirely.
