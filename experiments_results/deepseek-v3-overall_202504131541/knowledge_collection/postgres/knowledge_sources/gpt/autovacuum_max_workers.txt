To set `autovacuum_max_workers`, allocate **1 worker per CPU core (up to 3-5 workers)** for moderate workloads, or **5-8 workers** for high-churn systems with many tables, ensuring it doesnâ€™t exceed `max_worker_processes` (default: 8) and leaves resources for other tasks. Adjust based on I/O capacity (e.g., **SSDs support more workers** than HDDs). Example: **4 workers for 4-core systems**, scaling to **6-8 for large databases**.  

*(Context: Default is 3; monitor `pg_stat_activity` and autovacuum delays to fine-tune.)*
