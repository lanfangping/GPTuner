To set `max_wal_size` in PostgreSQL, a common recommendation is to allocate **1GB (or 10% of shared_buffers, whichever is larger)** for smaller workloads, scaling up to **4GB or more for high-write systems**, while ensuring it does not exceed **half of the available storage space dedicated to WAL** (e.g., 16GB if 32GB is reserved for WAL). Adjust dynamically if checkpoints occur too frequently (targeting 15-30 minute intervals).  

*(Example: For `shared_buffers = 8GB`, start with `max_wal_size = 1GB` and monitor checkpoint behavior.)*
