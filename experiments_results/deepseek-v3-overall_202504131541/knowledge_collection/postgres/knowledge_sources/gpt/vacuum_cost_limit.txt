To set the `vacuum_cost_limit` in PostgreSQL, a common starting point is **200-2000** (default is 200), balancing it with `vacuum_cost_delay` (default 0) to control I/O loadâ€”higher values allow more work per delay, while lower values reduce I/O impact; for example, **2000** is often used with SSDs, while **200-500** suits HDDs or conservative tuning. Adjust based on monitoring autovacuum performance and system latency tolerance.
