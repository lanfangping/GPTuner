To set `effective_cache_size` in PostgreSQL, allocate **50-75% of the system's total RAM** (e.g., **8GB** for a machine with **16GB RAM**), accounting for OS and other processes, while ensuring it doesnâ€™t exceed the OS's file cache capacity.  

*(Example: If the server has 32GB RAM, a typical setting would be **24GB (75%)**.)*
