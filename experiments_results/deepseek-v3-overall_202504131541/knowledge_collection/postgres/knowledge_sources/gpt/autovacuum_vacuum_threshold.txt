To set `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`, adjust it based on your table's update/delete activity: the default is **50 rows**, but for heavily modified tables, increase it (e.g., **100–500 rows**) to reduce autovacuum frequency, or decrease it (e.g., **20–50 rows**) for more aggressive cleanup if bloat is a concern. Always pair it with `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` (default **0.2**) for a combined threshold formula: `threshold + (scale_factor × table_size)`.
