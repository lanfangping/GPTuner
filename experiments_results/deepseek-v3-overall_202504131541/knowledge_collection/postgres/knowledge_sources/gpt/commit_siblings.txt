To set the `commit_siblings` knob in PostgreSQL, a common recommendation is to configure it to **5** (default) for general workloads, but increase it to **10â€“20** on high-concurrency systems with many concurrent transactions to reduce contention by delaying commit delays when at least that many sibling transactions are active. Adjust based on observed lock contention and throughput.
