The `log_autovacuum_min_duration` parameter logs autovacuum actions that run for at least the specified time (e.g., 250ms), logs skipped actions when not set to -1 (default), and can be set globally (e.g., in postgresql.conf) or overridden per table, with 0 logging all actions and -1 disabling logging entirely.
