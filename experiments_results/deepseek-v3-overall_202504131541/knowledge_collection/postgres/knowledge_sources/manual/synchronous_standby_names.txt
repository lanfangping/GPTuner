The `synchronous_standby_names` parameter specifies a list of standby servers (e.g., `FIRST 3 (s1, s2, s3, s4)` or `ANY 3 (s1, s2, s3, s4)`) that support synchronous replication, where transactions wait for confirmation from either the top 3 prioritized standbys (priority-based) or any 3 standbys (quorum-based) before committing, ensuring high availability and data protection.
