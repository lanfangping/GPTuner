The 'shared_preload_libraries' knob specifies one or more shared libraries (comma-separated, with optional double quotes for names containing whitespace or commas) to be preloaded at server startup, required for libraries needing postmaster-start operations like shared memory allocation (e.g., *pg_stat_statements*), but it increases new process startup time slightly (even if unused) and requires a server restart to modify, making it unsuitable for temporary debugging (use *session_preload_libraries* instead). On Windows, preloading does not reduce process startup time, as each process reloads libraries, but remains essential for postmaster-start operations.
