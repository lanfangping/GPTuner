The `wal_buffers` parameter sets the amount of shared memory for unflushed WAL data, defaulting to 1/32nd of `shared_buffers` (min 64kB, max 16MB), with a floor of 32kB if manually set lower, and values without units treated as 8kB blocks. A few MB (e.g., 4MBâ€“16MB) can improve write performance under high concurrent commits.
