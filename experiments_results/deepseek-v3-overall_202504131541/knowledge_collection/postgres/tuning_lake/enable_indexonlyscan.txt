{'suggestion': "The 'enable_indexonlyscan' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of index-only scans, defaulting to **on**. It is essential to have 'enable_indexscan' enabled for the planner to consider index-only scans. Enable it ('on'/'true' or '1') for queries that benefit from index-only scans, such as those where covering indexes reduce I/O. Disable it ('off'/'false' or '0') to force alternative plans if index-only scans perform poorly, for instance, due to high heap-fetch overhead or frequent index updates."}
