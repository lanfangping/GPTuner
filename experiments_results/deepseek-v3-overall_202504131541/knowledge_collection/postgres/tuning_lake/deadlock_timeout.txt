{'suggestion': {'description': "The 'deadlock_timeout' in PostgreSQL should be set to a default value of 1 second (1000 milliseconds), which balances between avoiding unnecessary delays in deadlock detection and minimizing overhead. This setting also controls lock-wait logging when 'log_lock_waits' is enabled. For systems with high contention, consider cautiously increasing the timeout (e.g., 5s-10s) if false deadlock checks are impacting performance, ensuring it exceeds typical transaction durations to balance unnecessary checks with delayed error reporting."}}
