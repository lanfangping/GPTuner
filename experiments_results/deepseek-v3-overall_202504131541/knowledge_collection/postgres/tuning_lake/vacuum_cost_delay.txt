{'suggestion': 'For the PostgreSQL knob `vacuum_cost_delay`, it is recommended to set it to under 1 millisecond (default is 0) to specify the sleep time for a vacuum process when the cost limit is exceeded. Note that fractional delays may be inaccurate on older platforms, which might require adjustments to other cost parameters instead. This recommendation prioritizes the manual_suggestion over the gpt_suggestion, which proposed a range of 2â€“10 milliseconds, due to the higher priority of the manual_suggestion.'}
