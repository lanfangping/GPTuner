{'suggestion': "The `wal_compression` parameter in PostgreSQL should be enabled (default: off) to reduce WAL volume by compressing full page images, which typically achieves 2x-4x compression ratios. This setting trades increased CPU usage during compression (logging) and decompression (replay) for storage savings without compromising data integrity. Enable it for high-write workloads to reduce WAL volume, but consider disabling it if CPU usage is a concern and I/O isn't a bottleneck."}
