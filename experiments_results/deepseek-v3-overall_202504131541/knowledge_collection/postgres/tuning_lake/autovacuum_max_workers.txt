{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_max_workers' parameter sets the maximum number of autovacuum processes (excluding the launcher) that can run simultaneously, with a default value of 3, and it can only be configured at server startup. For optimal performance, consider allocating 1 worker per CPU core (up to 3-5 workers) for moderate workloads, or 5-8 workers for high-churn systems with many tables, ensuring it doesnâ€™t exceed 'max_worker_processes' (default: 8) and leaves resources for other tasks. Adjust based on I/O capacity, where SSDs can support more workers than HDDs. Example configurations include 4 workers for 4-core systems, scaling to 6-8 for large databases. Monitoring 'pg_stat_activity' and autovacuum delays is recommended to fine-tune the setting."}
