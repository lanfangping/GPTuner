{'suggestion': "The 'enable_seqscan' parameter in PostgreSQL, which defaults to 'on', controls the query planner's use of sequential scans. Setting it to 'off' discourages sequential scans in favor of indexed access when alternative methods like index scans are available, though it does not entirely prevent them. This is particularly useful for query optimization where indexed access is preferred. However, consider keeping it 'on' for scenarios where sequential scans might be more efficient, such as when fetching a large percentage of rows from a table (e.g., more than 30%) or when indexes are not effective. Example usage includes `SET enable_seqscan = off;` for optimizing indexed queries."}
