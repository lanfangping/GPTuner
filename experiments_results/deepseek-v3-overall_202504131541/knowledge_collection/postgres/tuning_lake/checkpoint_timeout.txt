{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'checkpoint_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL sets the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints, with a default value of 5 minutes (300 seconds). A common recommendation is to configure it between 5 minutes (300s) and 30 minutes (1800s), balancing between recovery time (shorter timeouts) and write performance (longer timeouts). Increasing it may extend crash recovery time and lead to larger I/O spikes, which can be mitigated by tuning 'checkpoint_completion_target' and bgwriter activity. However, more frequent checkpoints create in aggregation more I/O, so raising it typically improves I/O usage. Adjust based on workload and storage I/O capacity, ensuring it aligns with 'max_wal_size' to avoid excessive checkpoint spikes."}
