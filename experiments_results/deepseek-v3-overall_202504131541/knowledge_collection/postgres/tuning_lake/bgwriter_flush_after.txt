{'suggestion': {'description': "To optimize `bgwriter_flush_after`, consider your workload type: for **light workloads**, a lower value (e.g., `64`–`128` kB) is recommended; for **moderate workloads**, `256`–`512` kB may be suitable; and for **heavy write-intensive workloads**, increasing it to `1MB`–`2MB` can help reduce I/O pressure without causing excessive write bursts. It's important to monitor system performance and I/O to adjust accordingly. Remember, the value is in 8 kB units (e.g., `128` = 1MB). This setting forces the OS to write data to storage after the background writer accumulates more than the specified amount, which can reduce checkpoint stalls but might impact performance for workloads between shared_buffers and the OS page cache."}}
