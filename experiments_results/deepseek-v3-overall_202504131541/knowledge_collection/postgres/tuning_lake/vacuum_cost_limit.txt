{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To set the 'vacuum_cost_limit' in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to start with the default value of 200, which sets the accumulated cost threshold at which the vacuuming process pauses to sleep. This parameter can be adjusted based on the system's I/O load and performance monitoring. While higher values (up to 2000) may be suitable for SSDs allowing more work per delay, lower values (200-500) are advisable for HDDs or when a more conservative tuning is preferred. The adjustment should consider the balance with 'vacuum_cost_delay' to effectively manage the I/O impact on the system."}
