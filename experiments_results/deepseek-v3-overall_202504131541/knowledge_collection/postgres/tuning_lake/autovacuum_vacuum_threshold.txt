{'suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' parameter determines the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples needed to initiate a VACUUM operation on a table, with a default setting of 50 rows. This setting can be adjusted either globally in the postgresql.conf file or on a per-table basis through storage parameters. For tables experiencing high levels of update or delete activity, consider increasing this threshold (e.g., to 100–500 rows) to decrease the frequency of autovacuum operations. Conversely, for tables where bloat is a significant concern, lowering the threshold (e.g., to 20–50 rows) may be beneficial for more frequent cleanup. It's important to note that this parameter works in conjunction with 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' (default: 0.2), and the combined effect is calculated as 'threshold + (scale_factor × table_size)' to determine when autovacuum should be triggered."}
