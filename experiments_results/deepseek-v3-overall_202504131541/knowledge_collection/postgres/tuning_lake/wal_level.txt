{'suggestion': {'description': 'The `wal_level` knob in PostgreSQL determines the detail of WAL logging with three levels: `minimal` (least logging, no row data for certain operations), `replica` (default, supports archiving and replication), and `logical` (adds logical decoding info, increasing WAL volume, especially with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` and frequent UPDATE/DELETE operations). For most replication setups, `replica` is the typical choice. Changing the `wal_level` requires a server restart (`pg_ctl restart`) to apply the change. Prior to PostgreSQL 9.6, `archive` and `hot_standby` were also valid options but now map to `replica`.'}}
