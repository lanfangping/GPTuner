{'suggestion': "To set `effective_io_concurrency` in PostgreSQL, adjust the value based on your storage subsystem's capability to handle concurrent I/O operations efficiently. For RAID 0/1 magnetic drives (excluding RAID 5 parity), use values between 2–8. For SSDs, consider values in the hundreds, and for high-end NVMe storage, scaling up to 16–32 may be appropriate. The default value is 1 (or 0 if unsupported). This recommendation prioritizes the manual_suggestion's guidance for RAID configurations and SSDs, while incorporating the gpt_suggestion's advice for NVMe storage, ensuring a comprehensive approach to setting `effective_io_concurrency`."}
