{'suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' parameter is crucial for managing the total cost limit for autovacuum operations, with its value being distributed proportionally among workers. For instance, setting it to 200 with 4 workers assigns each a limit of 50. While a common starting range is 200–1000, adjusting this value higher (e.g., 1000) can speed up autovacuum if it's too slow, or lower (e.g., 200–500) if performance is impacted. It's important to also consider tuning 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' (default: 2ms) in proportion. Monitoring 'pg_stat_progress_vacuum' is recommended to fine-tune these settings based on your specific workload and hardware."}
