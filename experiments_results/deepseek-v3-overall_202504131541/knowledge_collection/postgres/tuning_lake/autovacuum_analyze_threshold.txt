{'suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold' parameter determines the minimum number of tuple changes (inserts, updates, or deletes) needed to initiate an ANALYZE operation on a table. While the default setting is 50 tuples, it can be adjusted for individual tables through storage parameters. For a more tailored approach, consider setting it to **50 + (0.1 Ã— table size in tuples)**, which means the autovacuum analyzer activates after 50 changes plus 10% of the table's row count (for instance, a 10,000-row table would have a threshold of 1,050 changes). Fine-tuning should be based on the workload's volatility and ongoing monitoring."}
