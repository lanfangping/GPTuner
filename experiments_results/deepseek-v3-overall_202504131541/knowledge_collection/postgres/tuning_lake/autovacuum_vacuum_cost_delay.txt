{'suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` parameter, which sets the cost delay for autovacuum operations with a default of 2ms (milliseconds unless specified otherwise), can be configured in `postgresql.conf`, via server command line, or per-table through storage parameters. For optimal performance, start with the default setting and consider adjusting it lower (e.g., `0ms` or `1ms`) for aggressive vacuuming on high-I/O systems, or higher (e.g., `5ms`â€“`20ms`) to lessen I/O impact on busy workloads, thereby finding a balance between vacuum efficiency and system performance.'}
