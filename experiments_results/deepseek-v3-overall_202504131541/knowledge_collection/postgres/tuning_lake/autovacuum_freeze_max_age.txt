{'suggestion': "The `autovacuum_freeze_max_age` parameter should be set to a value between 100â€“200 million transactions (default: 200M) to balance aggressive freeze prevention against autovacuum overhead. It's crucial to ensure this value is at least 20% higher than `vacuum_freeze_table_age` (default: 150M) to avoid forced anti-wraparound vacuums. This parameter not only forces a VACUUM to prevent transaction ID wraparound when the transaction age reaches the set maximum, even if autovacuum is disabled, but also facilitates the cleanup of old pg_xact files. Example: `SET autovacuum_freeze_max_age = 180000000;`."}
