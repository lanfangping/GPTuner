{'suggestion': {'description': "The 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' parameter is set to a default value of 0.2 (20% of a table's size) to determine when to trigger a VACUUM by adding to 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold'. This parameter can be adjusted globally in postgresql.conf or per-table via storage parameters. For large tables, consider lowering the value (e.g., to 0.05 or 5%) to ensure more frequent vacuums, or increase it (e.g., to 0.5) for small, low-churn tables to reduce overhead. It's important to monitor table bloat and workload to fine-tune the setting, keeping in mind that the optimal value depends on table size, update frequency, and performance requirements."}}
