{'suggestion': "The 'enable_partition_pruning' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's ability to eliminate partitions from query plans, thereby improving performance by reducing the amount of data scanned. It is enabled by default ('on') in PostgreSQL 11 and later versions, as detailed in Section 5.11.4. For most workloads, keeping it enabled is recommended to improve query performance on partitioned tables, potentially reducing execution time by 20-50%. However, it should be disabled ('off' or 'false') only for debugging purposes or in edge cases where partition pruning causes issues."}
