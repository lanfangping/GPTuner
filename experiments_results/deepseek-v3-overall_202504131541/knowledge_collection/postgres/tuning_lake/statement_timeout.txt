{'suggestion': "To effectively manage the `statement_timeout` in PostgreSQL, it's crucial to understand its function: it aborts any statement that exceeds the specified time, with the default setting being 0 (disabled). The timeout is measured in milliseconds unless units are specified. For setting the timeout, consider your workload: opt for **30s-1min** for interactive queries, **5-10min** for batch jobs, or keep it disabled (0) for long-running analytics. Adjust higher (e.g., **1h+**) for specific ETL processes as necessary. Always ensure to test these settings under realistic loads to confirm their appropriateness for your environment."}
