{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'max_connections' knob in PostgreSQL determines the maximum number of concurrent database connections, with a default value of 100 unless limited by kernel settings during initdb. It must match or exceed the master server's value on a standby and can only be configured at server startup. For optimal performance, consider using connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer) to manage connections efficiently. When using connection pooling in transaction mode, set this parameter as a low multiple (2-5x) of the number of cores on the server. In session mode, set it to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued. If not using connection pooling, set it to the required number of concurrent users, but be aware that performance may be suboptimal. Additionally, monitor memory usage as each connection consumes approximately 10MB, and ensure that the total does not exceed 80% of available RAM or kernel limits (e.g., `ulimit -n`)."}
