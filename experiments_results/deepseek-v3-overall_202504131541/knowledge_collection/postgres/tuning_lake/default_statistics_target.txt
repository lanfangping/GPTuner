{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `default_statistics_target` knob in PostgreSQL sets the default statistics target for table columns with a default value of 100. Adjusting this value higher (e.g., 200â€“1000) can improve query planner estimates and is particularly beneficial for large tables or complex workloads, though it increases ANALYZE time and storage usage. For medium-sized systems, a value around 200 is often sufficient, while large systems may require values up to 500 or 1000. Lower values (e.g., 10-50) may be adequate for simple queries or in resource-constrained environments, but the primary recommendation is to consider raising the value for improved accuracy in query planning, especially in larger or more complex systems.'}
