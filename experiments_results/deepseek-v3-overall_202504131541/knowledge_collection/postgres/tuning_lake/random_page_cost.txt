{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `random_page_cost` parameter in PostgreSQL, with a default value of 4.0, estimates the cost of random disk page fetches by modeling them as 40 times slower than sequential reads, assuming 90% are cached. However, this can be adjusted to better reflect actual storage performance. For SSDs, a value between 1.0 and 2.0 is recommended, with a typical default of 1.1, due to their similar random access profile. For fast HDDs, values between 2.0 to 4.0 are suggested, maintaining the default of 4.0. Higher values may be necessary for slow storage or uncached workloads. Adjustments should be based on benchmarked query performance relative to `seq_page_cost`, which has a default value of 1.0.'}
