{'suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age` parameter should be set to a value between **100 million (100,000,000)** and **200 million (200,000,000)**, based on your multixact activity, ensuring it is lower than `multixact_freeze_max_age` (default: 400 million) to prevent transaction ID wraparound while balancing autovacuum frequency. This setting helps in preventing multixact ID wraparound and enables cleanup of old files in `pg_multixact` subdirectories. Adjust the value lower for high multixact churn or smaller clusters, or higher for large clusters with infrequent multixact updates.'}
