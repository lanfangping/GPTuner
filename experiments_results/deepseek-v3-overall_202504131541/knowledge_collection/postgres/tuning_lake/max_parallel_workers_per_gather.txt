{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter should be carefully set considering the system's CPU cores and workload type. For systems with 4–8 CPU cores, a starting point of 2–4 workers is recommended, scaling up to half the available CPU cores for systems with more cores (e.g., 8 workers for 16 cores), but it should not exceed `max_worker_processes` and must leave resources for other queries. In high throughput OLTP systems, it's often better to limit this setting to 1 or 2 to avoid excessive resource consumption, whereas for analytical or data warehousing systems, a higher value, as a fraction of cores, may be beneficial. Each additional worker can significantly increase resource usage (e.g., 4 workers may consume up to 5x more CPU, memory, and I/O), so adjustments should be based on workload concurrency and monitoring. The default value is 2, but actual workers may be fewer due to system limits. It's also important to review the `work_mem` value accordingly as it affects this parameter."}
