{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'enable_nestloop'. 2. Research the function of 'enable_nestloop' in PostgreSQL. 3. Determine if 'enable_nestloop' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly from its normal operation. 4. Confirm if setting 'enable_nestloop' to a specific value (like 0 or -1) disables or changes its function in a way that is not part of a natural numerical order. 5. Based on the findings, classify 'enable_nestloop' as a 'special knob' or not.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "0"}
