{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'statement_timeout'. 2. Understand its regular operation: it sets the maximum allowed duration of any statement. 3. Determine if it has any special values: '0' means no timeout, which is a special case as it disables the timeout feature. 4. Compare this behavior to the definition of a 'special knob': it has a special value ('0') that changes its function significantly (disabling the feature). 5. Conclude that 'statement_timeout' is a special knob with a special value of '0'.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "0"}
