{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit'. 2. Research the knob's functionality in PostgreSQL documentation. 3. Determine if the knob has any special values that deviate from its numerical ordering and perform a different function. 4. Based on the documentation, 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' does not have special values like -1 or 0 that change its functionality; it operates within a numerical range to limit the cost of autovacuum operations. 5. Conclude that 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' is not a special knob.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
