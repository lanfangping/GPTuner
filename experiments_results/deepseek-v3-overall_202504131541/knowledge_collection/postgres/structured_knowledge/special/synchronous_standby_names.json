{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'synchronous_standby_names' in PostgreSQL. 2. Research its functionality and possible values. 3. Determine if it has any special values that deviate from its normal numerical or ordered behavior. 4. Confirm if setting it to a specific value (like an empty string or a specific keyword) changes its operation significantly, such as disabling synchronous replication. 5. Based on the findings, classify it as a 'special knob' if it meets the criteria.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "'' (empty string)"}
