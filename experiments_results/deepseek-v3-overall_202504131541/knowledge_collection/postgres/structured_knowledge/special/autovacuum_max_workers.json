{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'autovacuum_max_workers' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation, which is to specify the maximum number of autovacuum worker processes that can be running simultaneously. 3. Check if this knob has any special values that break its natural order or change its functionality significantly. 4. Upon research, it's found that setting 'autovacuum_max_workers' to 0 disables the autovacuum feature entirely, which is a significant deviation from its regular operation. 5. Conclude that 'autovacuum_max_workers' is a special knob because it has a special value (0) that changes its functionality fundamentally.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
