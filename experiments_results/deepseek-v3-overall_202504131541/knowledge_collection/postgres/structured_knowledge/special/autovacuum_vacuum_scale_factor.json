{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor. 2. Understand its regular function: it specifies a fraction of the table size to add to autovacuum_vacuum_threshold when deciding whether to trigger a VACUUM. 3. Research if this knob has any special values that alter its behavior significantly. 4. Determine if setting it to a specific value (like 0 or -1) disables or changes its function in a way that's not part of its natural order. 5. Conclude whether it's a 'special knob' based on the findings.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
