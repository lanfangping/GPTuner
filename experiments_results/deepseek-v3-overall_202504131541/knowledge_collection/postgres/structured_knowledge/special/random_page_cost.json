{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'random_page_cost' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation: it sets the planner's estimate of the cost of a non-sequentially fetched disk page. 3. Research if 'random_page_cost' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly. 4. Determine if setting 'random_page_cost' to a specific value (like -1 or 0) disables a feature or changes its operation fundamentally. 5. Conclude based on findings whether 'random_page_cost' is a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
