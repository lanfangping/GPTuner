{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'shared_preload_libraries' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation: it is used to specify one or more shared libraries to be preloaded at server start. 3. Determine if it has any special values that alter its behavior significantly. 4. Recognize that setting it to an empty string ('') can be considered a special value as it effectively disables the preloading of any libraries, which is a different behavior from specifying library names. 5. Conclude that 'shared_preload_libraries' can be classified as a 'special knob' due to this behavior.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": ""}
