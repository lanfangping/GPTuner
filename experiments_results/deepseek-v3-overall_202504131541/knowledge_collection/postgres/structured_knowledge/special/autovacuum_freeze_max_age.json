{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation, which is to specify the maximum age (in transactions) that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can attain before a VACUUM operation is forced to prevent transaction ID wraparound. 3. Determine if this knob has any special values that deviate from its regular numerical order and functionality. 4. Research PostgreSQL documentation to confirm that 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' does not have special values like -1 or 0 that would disable or significantly alter its functionality. 5. Conclude that 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' operates within a numerical range without special values that break its natural order.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
