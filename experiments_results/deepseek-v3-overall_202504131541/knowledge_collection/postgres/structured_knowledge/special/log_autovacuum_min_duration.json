{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'log_autovacuum_min_duration' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation: it specifies the minimum execution time above which autovacuum actions will be logged. 3. Check if it has any special values that alter its behavior significantly. 4. Discover that setting it to 0 logs all autovacuum actions, and -1 disables logging, which are behaviors significantly different from its regular operation. 5. Conclude that 'log_autovacuum_min_duration' is a special knob due to these special values.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "-1"}
