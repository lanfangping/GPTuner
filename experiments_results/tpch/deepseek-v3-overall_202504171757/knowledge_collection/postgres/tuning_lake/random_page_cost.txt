{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `random_page_cost` parameter in PostgreSQL, which defaults to 4.0, estimates the cost of non-sequential disk page fetches by modeling random access as significantly slower than sequential access. This parameter can be adjusted to influence the planner's preference for index scans based on your storage type. For SSDs, it is recommended to lower the value to around 1.1, reflecting their faster random access capabilities compared to traditional HDDs. If your disk technology has a random access profile similar to SSDs, setting it to a value in the range of 1.x (e.g., '1.2') is advisable. The adjustment should consider the specific characteristics of your storage system to optimize query performance. Benchmarking with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` can provide further insights for fine-tuning this parameter."}
