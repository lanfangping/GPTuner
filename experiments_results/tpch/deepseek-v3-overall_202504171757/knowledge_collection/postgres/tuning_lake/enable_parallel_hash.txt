{'summary_suggestion': "The 'enable_parallel_hash' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of parallel hash-join plans. It is enabled by default and only takes effect if hash-join plans are also enabled. For optimal performance, consider enabling it ('on') specifically for hash joins involving large tables (e.g., >1GB) to leverage parallel workers, which can be typically set to 2-4x the CPU cores. However, it may be beneficial to disable it ('off') for small tables or systems with limited resources to avoid unnecessary overhead."}
