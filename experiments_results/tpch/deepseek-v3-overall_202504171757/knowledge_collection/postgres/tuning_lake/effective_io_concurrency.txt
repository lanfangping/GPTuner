{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure the `effective_io_concurrency` parameter in PostgreSQL, consider the following guidelines: The default value is 1, which disables the feature. For systems using HDDs (rotational disks) or RAID setups, a recommended starting value is the number of drives (excluding RAID 5 parity), with magnetic RAID setups specifically benefiting from this approach. For SSDs or RAID arrays, values in the range of 100â€“200 are suggested, as they can handle higher levels of concurrent I/O operations. However, it's important to avoid setting values that exceed the disk's capacity to prevent unnecessary CPU overhead. This suggestion prioritizes the manual_suggestion for RAID setups and the gpt_suggestion for SSD configurations, ensuring a balanced approach based on the storage technology in use."}
