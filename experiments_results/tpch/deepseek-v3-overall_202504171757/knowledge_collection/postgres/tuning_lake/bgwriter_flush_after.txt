{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance through the 'bgwriter_flush_after' knob, it is recommended to adjust this setting based on your system's specific workload and I/O capacity. The default value is typically 512 kB, which forces the OS to write data to storage after accumulating 512kB of dirty data, aiming to reduce fsync stalls and improve transaction latency. However, for systems with light workloads or those utilizing SSDs, a smaller value (e.g., 64–128 kB) may be more beneficial. Conversely, for systems experiencing heavy write loads or using HDDs, a larger value (e.g., 512–1024 kB) can help reduce I/O overhead by delaying flushes. Note that performance may degrade for workloads that fall between the shared_buffers and the OS page cache size."}
