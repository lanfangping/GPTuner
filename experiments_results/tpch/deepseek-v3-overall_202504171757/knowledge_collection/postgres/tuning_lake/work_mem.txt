{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'To optimize PostgreSQL performance, adjust the `work_mem` parameter based on your workload type and system resources. For OLTP workloads, allocate **4MB–16MB per connection**, and for complex queries (e.g., sorts/joins), consider **64MB–256MB+**, ensuring the total memory usage (`work_mem × max_connections`) does not exceed **25% of RAM** to prevent swapping. For example, with 8GB RAM and 100 connections, start with **8MB** (`(8GB × 0.25) / 100 ≈ 20MB max per connection`). Monitor query performance and adjust accordingly. Be cautious of setting the value too high, as it may lead to memory contention or destabilize node throughput with many concurrent operations. The default value is 4MB, which is generally too low for modern systems; starting at 16MB is recommended for most scenarios. Remember, hash-based operations may require additional memory via `hash_mem_multiplier`. Always base your adjustments on actual query performance and system monitoring.'}
