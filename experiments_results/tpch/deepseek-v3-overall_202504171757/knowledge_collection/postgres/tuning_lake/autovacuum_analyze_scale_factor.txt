{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' parameter is used to determine when to trigger an ANALYZE by adding a percentage of a table's size to 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold', with a default value of 0.1 (10%). For optimal performance, it is recommended to adjust this value based on the volatility of the table: use lower values (e.g., 0.01 or 1%) for highly volatile tables to ensure more frequent updates of statistics, and higher values (e.g., 0.05 or 5%) for more stable tables to reduce overhead. Table-level overrides can be applied using storage parameters, such as `ALTER TABLE my_table SET (autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.02);` for a 2% threshold. Monitoring query plans and `pg_stat_user_tables.n_mod_since_analyze` can help in fine-tuning this setting."}
