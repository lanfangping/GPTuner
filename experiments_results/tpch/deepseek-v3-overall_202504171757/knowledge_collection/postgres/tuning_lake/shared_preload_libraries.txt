{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `shared_preload_libraries` knob in PostgreSQL is used to specify one or more shared libraries (comma-separated, with optional double quotes for names containing whitespace or commas) that need to be preloaded at server startup. This is essential for libraries requiring postmaster-start operations, such as shared memory allocation (e.g., `pg_stat_statements`). However, it slightly increases new process startup time, even if the libraries are unused, and requires a server restart (`pg_ctl restart`) for any modifications to take effect. This makes it unsuitable for temporary debugging purposes; instead, consider using `session_preload_libraries` for such cases. On Windows, while preloading doesn't reduce per-process startup time, it remains crucial for postmaster-start operations. To configure, edit the `postgresql.conf` file by specifying the required extensions (e.g., `'pg_stat_statements, auto_explain'`) under the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter. Ensure the extensions you plan to use are included, with `pg_stat_statements` or `pg_stat_monitor` being common choices."}
