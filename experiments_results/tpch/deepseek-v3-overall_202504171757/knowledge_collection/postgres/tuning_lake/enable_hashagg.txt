{'suggestion': "The 'enable_hashagg' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of hashed aggregation plans, with the default setting being on (1), allowing such optimizations unless explicitly disabled (0). For optimal performance, consider enabling it for large aggregations (typically >10,000 rows) or disabling it for small datasets (e.g., <1,000 rows) to favor sort-based aggregation, but it's recommended to benchmark both settings for your specific workload, as the exact row thresholds may vary based on hardware, query complexity, and PostgreSQL version."}
