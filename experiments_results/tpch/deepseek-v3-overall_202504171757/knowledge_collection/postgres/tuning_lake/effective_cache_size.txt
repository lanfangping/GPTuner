{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `effective_cache_size` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to influence the planner's assumption about the available disk cache for a query, considering shared buffers, kernel disk cache, and concurrent queries, without reserving memory or assuming cache persistence. A recommended approach is to allocate approximately system RAM minus (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) multiplied by 1.1, or a lower value if the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL. This setting does not affect the amount of physical RAM used by queries. Alternatively, allocating 50-75% of your system's total RAM (e.g., 8GB for a 12GB system) can balance PostgreSQL's assumption of available cache with OS/buffer needs, adhering to typical recommendations that range from half to three-quarters of RAM. The default setting is 4GB, or 512,000 blocks at 8kB each."}
