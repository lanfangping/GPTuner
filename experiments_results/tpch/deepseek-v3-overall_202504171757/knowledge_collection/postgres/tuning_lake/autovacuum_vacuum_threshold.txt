{'suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' parameter determines the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples needed to trigger a VACUUM operation, with a default value of 50. This setting can be adjusted globally in postgresql.conf or on a per-table basis using storage parameters. For optimal performance, consider adjusting the threshold higher (e.g., 100–500) for large tables to reduce vacuum frequency, or lower (e.g., 20–50) for small, heavily updated tables to ensure timely cleanup."}
