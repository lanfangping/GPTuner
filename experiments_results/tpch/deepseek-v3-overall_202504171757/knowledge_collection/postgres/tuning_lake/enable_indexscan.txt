{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_indexscan' parameter in PostgreSQL, which is set to 'on' by default, controls the query planner's use of index-scan and index-only-scan operations. These operations can significantly enhance performance for indexed queries by minimizing the need for full-table scans. While it's generally advisable to keep this setting enabled for most workloads, there may be scenarios, such as when accessing a large portion of the table's rows (e.g., more than 30%) or dealing with poorly selective indexes, where disabling it could lead to better performance by favoring sequential scans. It's recommended to benchmark different settings using 'EXPLAIN ANALYZE' to compare query execution plans before making any adjustments. Note that the 30% threshold is a heuristic and the optimal setting may vary based on specific query patterns and data distribution."}
