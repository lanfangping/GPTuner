{'suggestion': "The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` parameter is crucial for managing autovacuum operations. It sets the total cost limit for these operations, with the default value being -1, which means it uses `vacuum_cost_limit`. This limit is distributed proportionally among workers; for instance, with a limit of 200 and 4 workers, each worker gets 50. While a common approach suggests starting with a value between 200–1000 (default: 200) and adjusting it higher if autovacuum is too slow (e.g., 1000–2000) or lower to prevent excessive I/O contention, the primary guidance emphasizes understanding the parameter's role in distributing costs among workers and its default behavior."}
