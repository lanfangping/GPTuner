{'suggestion': "The 'enable_hashjoin' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of hash-join operations, with the default setting being 'on' (enabled). It is recommended to enable it ('on' or 'true') for large-table joins or complex queries where hash joins are efficient, such as when joining tables with millions of rows. However, consider disabling it ('off' or 'false') for small-table joins or OLTP workloads where nested loops may perform better, especially for tables with less than 1,000 rows. Adjustments should be based on query-plan analysis to optimize performance."}
