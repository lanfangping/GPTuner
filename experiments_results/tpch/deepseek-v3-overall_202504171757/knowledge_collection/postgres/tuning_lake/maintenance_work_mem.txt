{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `maintenance_work_mem` knob in PostgreSQL should be set higher than `work_mem` to optimize maintenance operations such as VACUUM and CREATE INDEX, with a default value of **64MB**. For systems with large RAM resources and significant write operations, it is advisable to increase this value to speed up maintenance tasks, keeping in mind that each autovacuum worker might use this amount of memory unless directly controlled by `autovacuum_work_mem`. A general guideline is to allocate **5% to 10% of total system RAM** (e.g., **512MB to 1GB on a 16GB system**) for typical maintenance operations, as larger values may yield diminishing returns. However, for specialized bulk loads or very large indexes, adjusting higher (e.g., **4GB**) may be beneficial. It's crucial to set this value cautiously to avoid excessive memory allocation when multiplied by `autovacuum_max_workers`."}
