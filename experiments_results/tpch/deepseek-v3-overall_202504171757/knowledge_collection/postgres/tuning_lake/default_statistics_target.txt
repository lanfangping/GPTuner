{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'default_statistics_target' knob in PostgreSQL sets the default statistics target for table columns, with a default value of 100. Adjusting this value affects the balance between query planning accuracy and the time taken for ANALYZE operations. For optimal performance, consider setting the value based on your system's size and workload complexity: medium-sized systems may perform well with values around 200, while large systems or those with complex workloads might benefit from increasing it to between 500 and 1000. Higher values improve query planner estimates for complex queries but increase ANALYZE time and storage usage. Note that there is no column-specific override via ALTER TABLE SET STATISTICS, making it important to choose a value that suits your overall database needs."}
