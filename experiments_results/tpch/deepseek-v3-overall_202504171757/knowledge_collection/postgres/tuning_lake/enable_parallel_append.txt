{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_parallel_append' knob in PostgreSQL is enabled by default, allowing the query planner to utilize parallel-aware append plan types for distributing workload across multiple workers, which can enhance performance. This feature is particularly beneficial for queries that involve large table scans with multiple workers (typically scaling with max_parallel_workers_per_gather, often defaulting to 2). While it is generally recommended to keep this setting enabled ('on') for scenarios that benefit from parallel execution, such as large table scans, it may be advisable to disable it ('off') for OLTP workloads characterized by small, frequent queries to minimize overhead. The default setting is 'on' in PostgreSQL 9.6 and later versions."}
