{'suggestion': {'description': 'The `wal_level` knob in PostgreSQL controls the level of detail in WAL logging with three main levels: *minimal* (least WAL, no row data for certain operations, and no support for replication or archiving), *replica* (default, supports archiving and replication, and is sufficient for most replication setups), and *logical* (adds support for logical decoding, required for logical replication or CDC tools like Debezium, but increases WAL volume, especially with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` and frequent updates/deletes). Prior to PostgreSQL 9.6, `archive` and `hot_standby` were valid values but now map to *replica*. For most needs, *replica* is the recommended setting unless logical replication or CDC tools are in use, in which case *logical* should be selected.'}}
