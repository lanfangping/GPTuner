{'comprehensive_suggestion': {'description': "The `backend_flush_after` knob in PostgreSQL is used to manage how data is written to storage, impacting performance based on the workload type. For optimal performance, it's recommended to adjust this setting according to your specific workload: disable it (set to 0) or set it higher (e.g., 1024) for bulk-load or batch-processing workloads to reduce I/O overhead, while for OLTP systems with frequent small writes, a value like 128 may be more appropriate. The default setting is 0, which helps in reducing dirty page cache buildup and improving checkpoint fsync latency, though it might degrade performance for certain workloads. Benchmarking with typical workloads is advised to fine-tune this setting.", 'values': {'OLTP': 128, 'bulk-load_or_batch-processing': {'disable': 0, 'higher': 1024}, 'default': 0}}}
