{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure the 'lock_timeout' setting in PostgreSQL effectively, it's crucial to understand its function: it aborts statements that wait longer than the specified time to acquire a lock, with the default value being 0 (disabled). The value is interpreted in milliseconds if no unit is provided (e.g., 5000 for 5 seconds), and this setting applies to each lock attempt, covering both explicit and implicit locks. For optimal performance across different workloads, consider the following guidelines: for OLTP systems, a starting range of 100ms-300ms is recommended to minimize long waits; for reporting queries, a range of 1s-10s may be more appropriate; and for maintenance tasks, setting it between 30s-5min or disabling it (0) could be beneficial, depending on the need to balance lock contention avoidance with the necessity for query completion. Always adjust these values based on actual observations of lock contention and query performance to fine-tune your PostgreSQL environment."}
