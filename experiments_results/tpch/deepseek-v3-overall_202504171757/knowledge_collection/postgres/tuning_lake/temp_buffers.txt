{'suggestion': "The `temp_buffers` knob in PostgreSQL sets the maximum memory per session for temporary table buffers, with a default of **8MB** (or proportionally scaled if `BLCKSZ` differs from **8kB**). Each active buffer consumes **8kB** (or `BLCKSZ`), and unused increments cost **64 bytes** per buffer descriptor. While it's important to allocate based on the expected size of temporary data workloads, especially for complex queries or large sorts/hashes, avoid excessive settings as they are session-local and non-shared."}
