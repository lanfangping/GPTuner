{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` parameter determines the fraction of a table's size (default 0.2, or 20%) added to `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` to decide when to trigger a VACUUM operation, with table-specific overrides possible via storage parameters. For tables with moderate churn, a common starting point is **0.2% (0.002)**, but for large or heavily updated tables, consider lowering it to **0.1% (0.001)** or even **0.05% (0.0005)** to trigger vacuums more aggressively, while balancing overhead. Adjustments should be based on monitoring table bloat and autovacuum frequency."}
