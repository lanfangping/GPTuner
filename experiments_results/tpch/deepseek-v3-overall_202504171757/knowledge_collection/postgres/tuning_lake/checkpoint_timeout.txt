{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'checkpoint_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL sets the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints, with a default value of 5 minutes (300 seconds). It is advisable to adjust this setting based on your workload and recovery needs. Increasing the value (e.g., to 15 minutes) can reduce I/O usage by decreasing the frequency of checkpoints, but may lead to larger I/O spikes and longer recovery times after a crash. Conversely, a lower value (e.g., 5 minutes) results in more frequent checkpoints, which can decrease recovery time but increase I/O overhead. Monitoring `pg_stat_bgwriter` is recommended to fine-tune this parameter according to your system's I/O capacity and crash recovery tolerance. The value can be set in `postgresql.conf` in seconds (e.g., `checkpoint_timeout = 900` for 15 minutes)."}
