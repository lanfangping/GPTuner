{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'max_wal_size' in PostgreSQL should be set considering both the system's workload and disk space availability. A good starting point is the default value of 1 GB, which serves as a soft limit for WAL growth during automatic checkpoints. For systems with smaller workloads, allocating 1GB or 10% of shared_buffers (whichever is larger) is advisable, scaling up to 4GB or more for high-write systems. It's crucial to ensure that 'max_wal_size' is at least twice the size of the largest transaction. For very active databases, consider setting it to 16GB. Increasing 'max_wal_size' can help ensure that automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout rather than by disk space, though it's important to note that higher values may increase recovery time after a crash. Monitoring WAL growth to adjust 'max_wal_size' dynamically is recommended, taking into account the write volume, checkpoint frequency, and disk I/O capacity. Under heavy load or special circumstances, the soft limit can be exceeded."}
