{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_partition_pruning' knob in PostgreSQL is enabled by default to improve query performance by allowing the query planner to eliminate unnecessary partitions from query plans and during execution, thereby reducing the number of partitions processed. It is recommended to keep it enabled for most workloads to achieve performance gains, such as 2â€“10x speedups for large partitioned tables. However, it may be disabled for testing or in specific edge cases where the overhead of pruning outweighs its benefits, such as with very small tables or frequent partition changes. Benchmarking with typical queries is advised to confirm the performance improvements."}
