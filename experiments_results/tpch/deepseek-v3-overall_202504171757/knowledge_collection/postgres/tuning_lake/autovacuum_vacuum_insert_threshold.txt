{'comprehensive_suggestion': {'description': 'The `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` parameter determines the minimum number of inserted tuples required to trigger an autovacuum VACUUM operation on a table, and it can be customized per table via storage parameters. A good starting point is **50–100**, adjusting it lower (e.g., **20–50**) for tables with high insert rates to trigger vacuums more aggressively, or higher (e.g., **200–500**) for mostly static tables to reduce overhead. Monitor table churn (`n_dead_tup`) and tune accordingly. *(Note: The default is `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` + `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` = 1000, so if the base threshold is 50, inserts add to this.)*'}}
