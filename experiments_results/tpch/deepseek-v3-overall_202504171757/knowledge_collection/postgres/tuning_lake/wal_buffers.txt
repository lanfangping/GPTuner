{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `wal_buffers` knob in PostgreSQL controls the shared memory for unwritten WAL data. It defaults to 1/32nd of `shared_buffers`, with a floor of 32kB if manually set lower, and values without units are treated as 8kB blocks. For optimal performance, ensure it covers at least 3 WAL segments (typically 48MB, as each segment is 16MB). Example: if `shared_buffers` is 8GB, setting `wal_buffers = 64MB` would be appropriate.'}
