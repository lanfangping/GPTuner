{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `shared_buffers` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to allocate memory for shared memory buffers. For dedicated servers with at least 1GB of RAM, a recommended starting value is 25% of the system memory, with a maximum of up to 40% for optimal performance, ensuring not to exceed 8GB in any scenario. Smaller systems should allocate less to preserve OS resources, with a minimum of 128MB for very small setups or 1-4GB for general-purpose use. It's important to adjust this parameter based on the workload; OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems may benefit from higher values, whereas OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems might prioritize other settings. Additionally, for systems with hundreds of GBs of RAM, consider setting up huge pages. This setting is also related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`, and it's advisable to conduct benchmarks to fine-tune the parameter for your specific environment. Each PostgreSQL instance will reserve its own memory allocations, so adjustments should be made accordingly for non-dedicated servers."}
