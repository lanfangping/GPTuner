{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` parameter sets the cost delay for automatic VACUUM operations, with a default value of 2ms when no unit is specified. It can be adjusted per-table via storage parameters or set to -1 to fall back to `vacuum_cost_delay`. For optimal performance, consider starting with the default value and adjust lower (e.g., 2–10ms) for aggressive vacuuming on high-I/O systems or higher (e.g., 50–100ms) to reduce I/O impact on latency-sensitive workloads, ensuring a balance between vacuum efficiency and system load.'}
