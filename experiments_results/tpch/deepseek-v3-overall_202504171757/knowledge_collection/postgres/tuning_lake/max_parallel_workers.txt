{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `max_parallel_workers` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to a value that does not exceed `max_worker_processes`, with a common recommendation being to allocate 50-75% of the total CPU cores (e.g., 4-6 workers on an 8-core system) to ensure system resources are optimally utilized without overloading. This setting should be adjusted in conjunction with `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` and `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` for balanced performance across different operations. The default value is 8, but adjustments should be made based on the specific workload concurrency and system load to maintain efficiency.'}
