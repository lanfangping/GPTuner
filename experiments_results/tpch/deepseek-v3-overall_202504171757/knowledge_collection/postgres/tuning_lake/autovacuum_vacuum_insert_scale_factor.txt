{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To effectively manage the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to set it based on the insert rate of your workload. The default value is 0.2 (20% of the table's size), which can be adjusted according to the table's activity level: decrease it (e.g., to 0.05–0.1) for tables with high insert rates to trigger vacuums more frequently, or increase it (e.g., to 0.3–0.5) for tables with low activity to minimize overhead. This parameter can be configured globally in postgresql.conf or via the server command line, and can also be specified for individual tables using storage parameters. Monitoring table bloat and autovacuum frequency is essential to fine-tune this setting for optimal performance."}
