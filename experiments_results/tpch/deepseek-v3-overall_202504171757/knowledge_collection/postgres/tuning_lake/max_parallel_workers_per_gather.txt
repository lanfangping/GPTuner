{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter should be carefully configured based on the system's workload and available resources. For systems with *N* CPU cores, a starting value could be *N/2* (e.g., 4 on an 8-core server), but adjustments should be made according to the workload type: lower values (1 or 2) are recommended for high throughput OLTP systems to avoid excessive resource usage, while higher values (up to *N-1*) may be suitable for analytical or data warehousing (DW) systems. It's important to note that each additional worker can significantly increase resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O), up to 5x compared to non-parallel queries. Additionally, ensure that `max_worker_processes` and `max_parallel_workers` are configured to support the chosen value of `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`. Reviewing the `work_mem` parameter is also advised to optimize performance."}
