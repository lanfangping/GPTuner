{'suggestion': "The 'enable_seqscan' parameter in PostgreSQL, which defaults to 'on', controls the query planner's use of sequential scans. It is recommended to disable it ('enable_seqscan = off') when query performance testing indicates that sequential scans are significantly slower (e.g., >10x) than index scans for critical queries. However, it should generally remain enabled ('enable_seqscan = on') by default to allow the planner to utilize sequential scans for large table scans or small datasets where they are more efficient (e.g., tables <1% of shared_buffers). Disabling this parameter discourages, but does not entirely prevent, the use of sequential scans if alternative methods like index scans are available."}
