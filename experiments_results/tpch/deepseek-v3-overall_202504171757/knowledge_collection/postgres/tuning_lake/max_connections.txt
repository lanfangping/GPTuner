{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'max_connections' knob in PostgreSQL determines the maximum number of concurrent database connections, with a default of 100 (or lower if limited by kernel settings during initdb). It requires a server restart to modify and must match or exceed the master server's value on a standby server to allow queries. For optimal performance, consider using connection pooling. In transaction mode, set this parameter as a low multiple (2-5x) of the number of cores on the server. If running in session mode, set it to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued. Without connection pooling, set it to the required number of concurrent users, keeping in mind that performance may be suboptimal. Additionally, ensure RAM is sufficient by calculating that `work_mem` Ã— `max_connections` does not exceed 75% of total memory. Adjust the number of connections based on your workload, with OLTP systems potentially needing more and OLAP systems fewer connections."}
