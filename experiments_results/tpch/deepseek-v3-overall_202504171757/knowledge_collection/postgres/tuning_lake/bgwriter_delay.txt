{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `bgwriter_delay` parameter sets the sleep interval between background writer rounds, with a default of 200ms and a typical resolution of 10ms. It flushes dirty buffers before pausing, unless no buffers need writing, in which case it sleeps longer regardless of this setting. For systems with a heavy write workload, consider adjusting the delay to reduce I/O contention, potentially increasing it to 300â€“500ms, or decreasing it to 100ms for faster checkpointing if the disk subsystem can handle frequent writes without performance degradation. The adjustment should be based on the specific write workload and system resources.'}
