{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `hash_mem_multiplier` in PostgreSQL should be adjusted based on the available system memory and the specific workload demands. The default value is 1.0, but it can be increased to a range of 1.5-2.0 for mixed workloads or even higher (2.0-8.0+) when `work_mem` is already â‰¥40MB to minimize spilling and alleviate memory pressure. This adjustment helps in optimizing performance for hash-based operations such as joins and aggregates. It's crucial to monitor the system's performance, possibly using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, to ensure the setting meets the workload requirements without causing memory starvation for other operations."}
