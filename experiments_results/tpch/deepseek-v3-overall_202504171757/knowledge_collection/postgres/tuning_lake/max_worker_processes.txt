{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimally configure 'max_worker_processes' in PostgreSQL, start by understanding it sets the maximum number of background processes the system can support, with a default of 8. It's crucial to ensure standby servers have matching or higher values. Adjust this parameter in conjunction with related parallel worker settings such as 'max_parallel_workers' and 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather'. For allocation, a balanced approach is to set it to 1 worker per CPU core (e.g., 8 for an 8-core server), ensuring it does not exceed the sum of 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather', 'max_parallel_workers', and other background workers. In scenarios expecting heavily parallelized workloads, consider capping at 2x CPU cores (e.g., 16 for 8 cores) to accommodate, while always leaving room for maintenance tasks. Adjustments should be made based on the specific workload parallelism and available system resources. For example, a 4-core server with moderate parallelism might set this to 4, whereas high parallelism could justify up to 8."}
