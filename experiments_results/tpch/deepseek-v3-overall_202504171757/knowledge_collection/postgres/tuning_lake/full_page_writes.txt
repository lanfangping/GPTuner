{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `full_page_writes` knob in PostgreSQL is enabled by default to ensure crash recovery by writing the entire disk page to WAL during its first post-checkpoint modification, preventing partial page corruption. While this increases WAL volume, adjusting the checkpoint interval can mitigate overhead. Disabling it (`full_page_writes = off`) can improve performance if you have a battery-backed write cache or a reliable filesystem (like ZFS with atomic writes), but doing so risks unrecoverable or silent corruption, similar to but less severe than turning off `fsync`. It's generally safe to disable on modern storage with power loss protection, but always benchmark and verify durability requirements before making changes."}
