{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'checkpoint_completion_target' knob in PostgreSQL should be set to aim for checkpoints to complete 50% (default 0.5) of the way through the interval between checkpoints to spread I/O load evenly. This setting helps in balancing the I/O load during checkpoints, ensuring that the system does not experience significant write spikes while also maintaining an optimal recovery time. While higher values (such as 0.7â€“0.9) can be considered to further smooth out I/O activity over larger periods, especially on development instances where it might be set to '0.9', the primary recommendation is to adhere to the default or slightly adjusted values based on specific storage latency considerations (e.g., 0.8 for SSDs, 0.7 for HDDs). It's important to note that if this setting is used for feeding non-streaming replicas, keeping it within a low percentage is advisable."}
