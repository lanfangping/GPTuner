{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_max_workers' parameter should be set to a maximum of 3 concurrent autovacuum worker processes (excluding the launcher) as this is the default and can only be configured at server startup. While allocating 1 worker per CPU core (up to 3-5 workers for typical systems) is a consideration, the primary guidance is to adhere to the default setting of 3 unless specific server conditions and resources permit adjustments beyond this, ensuring not to exceed the server's available CPU capacity or RAM to avoid resource contention."}
