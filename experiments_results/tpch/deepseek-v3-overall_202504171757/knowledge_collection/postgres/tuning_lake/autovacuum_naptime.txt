{'suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_naptime' parameter in PostgreSQL sets the minimum delay between autovacuum runs on a database. It is recommended to configure this parameter in postgresql.conf or via the server command line, with a default value of **60 seconds (1 minute)**. While a typical value might range between **1â€“5 seconds** for systems requiring more frequent vacuuming, especially under busy conditions, it's crucial to adjust this setting based on the specific workload and monitoring outcomes to ensure optimal performance. The priority is to follow the manual configuration advice, ensuring compatibility and system requirements are met."}
