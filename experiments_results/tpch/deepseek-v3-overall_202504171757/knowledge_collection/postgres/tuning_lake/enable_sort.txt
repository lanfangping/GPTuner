{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_sort' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of explicit sort steps. It defaults to 'on' but can be set to 'off' to discourage the use of sorts when alternative methods (e.g., index scans) are available, though it cannot entirely eliminate them. Enable it ('on' or 'true') for queries that benefit from explicit sorting, such as those with 'ORDER BY' operations, or disable it ('off' or 'false') to force alternative plans when sorting is inefficient. Benchmarking with 'EXPLAIN ANALYZE' is recommended to validate the performance impact of changing this setting."}
