{'summary_suggestion': {'description': "The `autovacuum_work_mem` parameter should be set to a maximum of **1GB** for dead tuple collection, as allocating more memory beyond this limit provides no additional benefit. A common starting point for moderate workloads is **256MB**, but it can be adjusted higher (up to 1GB) if autovacuum processes are slow and additional RAM is available. It's important to ensure that this setting does not compete with `work_mem` or `maintenance_work_mem`. For example, on a system with 16GB of RAM, setting `autovacuum_work_mem` to 512MB is considered reasonable. The default value is often too low at 1MB, and if set to -1, it defaults to the `maintenance_work_mem` setting."}}
