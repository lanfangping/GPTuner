{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `autovacuum_freeze_max_age` parameter is crucial for preventing transaction ID wraparound by setting the maximum transaction age before a VACUUM is forced, even if autovacuum is disabled. The default value is 200 million transactions. It's important to choose a value within the range of 100â€“200 million transactions to balance between preventing transaction ID wraparound (favoring lower values) and reducing vacuum frequency (favoring higher values). Additionally, ensuring this value stays below `vacuum_freeze_table_age`, typically set to 95% of `autovacuum_freeze_max_age`, is recommended for optimal database maintenance."}
