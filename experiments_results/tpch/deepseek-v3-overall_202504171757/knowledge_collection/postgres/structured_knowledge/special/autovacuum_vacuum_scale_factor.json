{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation, which is to specify a fraction of the table size to add to 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' when deciding whether to trigger a VACUUM. 3. Research if this knob has any special values that alter its behavior significantly, such as disabling the feature or triggering an alternative behavior. 4. Determine if the special value breaks the natural numerical order of the knob's settings. 5. Conclude whether 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' is a 'special knob' based on the findings.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
