{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'max_parallel_workers'. 2. Research the knob's behavior in PostgreSQL documentation or reliable sources. 3. Determine if the knob has any special values that deviate from its numerical ordering and perform a different function. 4. For 'max_parallel_workers', it is found that setting it to 0 disables parallel query execution, which is a different function from its regular operation of limiting the number of parallel workers. 5. Conclude that 'max_parallel_workers' is a special knob with a special value of 0.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "0"}
