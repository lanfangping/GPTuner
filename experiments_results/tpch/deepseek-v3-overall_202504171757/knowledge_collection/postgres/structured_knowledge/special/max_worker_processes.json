{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'max_worker_processes'. 2. Research the function of 'max_worker_processes' in PostgreSQL. 3. Determine if 'max_worker_processes' has any special values that alter its function significantly from its regular numerical operation. 4. Based on PostgreSQL documentation, 'max_worker_processes' does not have special values like -1 or 0 that disable or significantly alter its function; it simply sets the maximum number of background worker processes. 5. Conclude that 'max_worker_processes' is not a 'special knob' as it does not have special values that break its natural order or function.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
