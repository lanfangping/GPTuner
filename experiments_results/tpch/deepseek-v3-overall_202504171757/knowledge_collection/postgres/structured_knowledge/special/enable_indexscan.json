{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'enable_indexscan' in PostgreSQL. 2. Research PostgreSQL documentation to understand the behavior of 'enable_indexscan'. 3. Determine if 'enable_indexscan' has any special values that alter its functionality beyond a simple on/off or numerical setting. 4. Confirm that setting 'enable_indexscan' to 'off' (or 'false') disables index scans entirely, which is a significant deviation from its normal operation where it enables the use of index scans based on the query planner's decision. 5. Conclude that 'enable_indexscan' is a special knob because it has a binary setting that fundamentally changes query execution behavior.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "off"}
