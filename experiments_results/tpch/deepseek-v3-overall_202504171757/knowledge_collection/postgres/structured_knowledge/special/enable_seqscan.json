{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'enable_seqscan' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its function: it controls whether the query planner will use sequential scan plan types. 3. Recognize that setting 'enable_seqscan' to 'off' (or 'false') disables sequential scans, which is a special behavior compared to its regular operation of enabling or adjusting the use of sequential scans. 4. Conclude that 'enable_seqscan' is a special knob because it has a special value ('off') that changes its function significantly.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
