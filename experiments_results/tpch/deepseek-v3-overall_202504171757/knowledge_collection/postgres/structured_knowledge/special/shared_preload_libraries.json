Understand its regular operation: it is used to specify one or more shared libraries to be preloaded at server start. 3. Determine if it has any special values that break its natural order or change its function significantly. 4. Recognize that setting 'shared_preload_libraries' to an empty string ('') can be considered a special value as it effectively disables the preloading of any libraries, which is a different function from its regular operation of specifying libraries to preload.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": ""}
