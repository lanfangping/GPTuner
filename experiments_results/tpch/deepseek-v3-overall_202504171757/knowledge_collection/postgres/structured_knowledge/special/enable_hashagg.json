{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'enable_hashagg'. 2. Research or recall if 'enable_hashagg' has any special values that deviate from its normal numerical operation. 3. Determine if setting 'enable_hashagg' to a specific value (like -1 or 0) changes its functionality significantly, such as disabling the feature entirely. 4. If such a special value exists, classify 'enable_hashagg' as a 'special knob' and note the special value. Otherwise, classify it as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "0"}
