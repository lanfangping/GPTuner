To set the `enable_seqscan` knob in PostgreSQL, disable it (`enable_seqscan = off`) when query performance testing shows sequential scans are significantly slower (e.g., >10x) than index scans for critical queries, but leave it on (`enable_seqscan = on`) by default to allow the planner to use sequential scans for large table scans or small datasets where they are faster (e.g., tables <1% of shared_buffers).
