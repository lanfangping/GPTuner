To set the `block_size` knob in PostgreSQL, use the default 8KB (recommended for most workloads) unless you have specific hardware or performance requirementsâ€”for example, 16KB or 32KB may improve throughput for large sequential scans on systems with high I/O bandwidth, but it must be set at initialization (`initdb`) and cannot be changed afterward without recreating the cluster.
