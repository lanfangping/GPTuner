To set the `autovacuum` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (default is `on`) and adjust related parameters like `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` (default `0.2`) and `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` (default `50`) based on table sizeâ€”for example, lower `scale_factor` to `0.05` for large tables to trigger vacuums more aggressively or increase the `threshold` to reduce overhead on small tables. Monitor performance and adjust as needed.
