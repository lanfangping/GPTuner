To set the `enable_hashagg` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (`on`) for optimal performance with large aggregations (typically >10,000 rows) or disable it (`off`) for small datasets (e.g., <1,000 rows) to favor sort-based aggregation, but benchmark both settings for your workload.  

(Note: The exact row thresholds may vary based on hardware, query complexity, and PostgreSQL version.)
