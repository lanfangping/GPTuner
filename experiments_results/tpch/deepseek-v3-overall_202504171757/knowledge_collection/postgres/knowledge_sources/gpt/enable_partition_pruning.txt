To set the `enable_partition_pruning` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (`on`/`true` by default) for most workloads to improve query performance by skipping irrelevant partitions, but disable it (`off`/`false`) only for testing or edge cases where pruning overhead outweighs benefits (e.g., very small tables or frequent partition changes). Benchmark with typical queries to confirm gains (e.g., 2â€“10x speedups for large partitioned tables).
