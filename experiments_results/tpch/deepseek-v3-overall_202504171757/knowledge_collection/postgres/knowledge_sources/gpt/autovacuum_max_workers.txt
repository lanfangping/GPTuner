To set `autovacuum_max_workers`, allocate **1 worker per CPU core (up to 3-5 workers for typical systems)**, but ensure the total does not exceed **50-80% of available CPU capacity** or **available RAM (each worker needs ~100-200MB)** to avoid resource contention. For example, on an **8-core system with 16GB RAM**, a value of **3-5** is often optimal. Adjust higher only if vacuum lag persists and resources permit.
