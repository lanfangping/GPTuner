To set the `checkpoint_timeout` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on your workload and recovery needs, typically between **5 minutes (300s)** for frequent checkpoints (lower recovery time but higher I/O overhead) and **30 minutes (1800s)** for less frequent checkpoints (higher recovery time but reduced I/O), with the default being **5 minutes (300s)**; monitor `pg_stat_bgwriter` to fine-tune for your system's I/O capacity and crash recovery tolerance.  

*(Note: Values can be set in `postgresql.conf` as seconds, e.g., `checkpoint_timeout = 900` for 15 minutes.)*
