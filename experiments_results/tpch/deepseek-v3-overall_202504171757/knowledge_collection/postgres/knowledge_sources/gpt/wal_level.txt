To set the `wal_level` knob in PostgreSQL, choose one of the following values based on your needs: `minimal` (default, no replication or archiving), `replica` (supports replication and point-in-time recovery), or `logical` (adds logical decoding); for most replication setups, `replica` is sufficient, while `logical` is required for logical replication or CDC tools like Debezium.
