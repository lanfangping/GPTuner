To set `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor` in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on the rate of inserts in your workload: a typical starting value is **0.2** (20% of table size), but for high-insert tables, reduce it (e.g., **0.05–0.1**) to trigger vacuums more aggressively, while for low-churn tables, increase it (e.g., **0.3–0.5**) to reduce overhead. Monitor table bloat and autovacuum frequency to refine the value.  

*(Example: If a 10GB table sees heavy inserts, setting it to **0.1** ensures autovacuum triggers after ~1GB of new inserts.)*
