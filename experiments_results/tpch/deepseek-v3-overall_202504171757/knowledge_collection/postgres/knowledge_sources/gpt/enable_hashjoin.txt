To set the `enable_hashjoin` knob in PostgreSQL, typically enable it (`on` or `true`) for large-table joins or complex queries where hash joins are efficient (e.g., when joining tables with millions of rows), but disable it (`off` or `false`) for small-table joins or OLTP workloads where nested loops may perform better (e.g., tables with < 1,000 rows). Adjust based on query-plan analysis.
