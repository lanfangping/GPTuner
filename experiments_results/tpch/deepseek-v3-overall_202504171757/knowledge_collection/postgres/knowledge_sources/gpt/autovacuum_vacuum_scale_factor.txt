To set `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor`, a common starting point is **0.2% (0.002)** for tables with moderate churn, but for large or heavily updated tables, lower it to **0.1% (0.001)** or even **0.05% (0.0005)** to trigger vacuums more aggressively, while balancing overhead. Adjust based on monitoring table bloat and autovacuum frequency.
