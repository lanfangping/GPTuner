The 'lock_timeout' knob aborts any statement waiting longer than the specified time (default 0, meaning disabled) to acquire a lock, with the value interpreted as milliseconds if no unit is provided (e.g., 5000 for 5 seconds), and applies separately to each lock attempt, including both explicit and implicit locks.
