"The 'enable_seqscan' parameter, defaulting to 'on', controls the query planner's use of sequential scans, discouraging them (though not entirely preventing them) when set to 'off' if alternative methods like index scans are available."  

*(Note: Since the description does not provide concrete numerical thresholds or performance metrics, the summary focuses on the binary default state ('on') and the planner's behavioral shift when disabled.)*
