The `full_page_writes` knob, enabled by default, ensures crash recovery by writing the entire disk page (typically 8KB) to WAL during its first post-checkpoint modification, preventing partial page corruption at the cost of increased WAL volume, though checkpoint interval adjustments can mitigate overhead. Disabling it risks unrecoverable or silent corruption, similar to but less severe than turning off `fsync`.
