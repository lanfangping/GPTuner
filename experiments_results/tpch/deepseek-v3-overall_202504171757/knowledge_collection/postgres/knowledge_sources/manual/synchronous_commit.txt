The `synchronous_commit` knob controls WAL durability guarantees, with modes like `remote_apply` (waits for WAL replay on standby, highest safety), `on` (default, waits for WAL flush to disk on primary and standby), `remote_write` (waits for WAL write to standby OS cache), `local` (waits only for local WAL flush), and `off` (no wait, risking up to 3Ã— `wal_writer_delay` of data loss on crash).
