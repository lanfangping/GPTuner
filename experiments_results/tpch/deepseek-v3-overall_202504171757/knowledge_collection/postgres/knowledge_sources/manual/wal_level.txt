The `wal_level` knob controls WAL logging detail with three levels: *minimal* (least WAL, no row data for certain operations), *replica* (default, supports archiving and replication), and *logical* (adds logical decoding support, increasing WAL volume, especially with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` and frequent updates/deletes). Prior to PostgreSQL 9.6, `archive` and `hot_standby` were also valid but now map to *replica*.
