            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            KNOB: shared_buffers
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `shared_buffers` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to allocate memory for shared memory buffers. For dedicated servers with at least 1GB of RAM, a recommended starting value is 25% of the system memory, with a maximum of up to 40% for optimal performance, ensuring not to exceed 8GB in any scenario. Smaller systems should allocate less to preserve OS resources, with a minimum of 128MB for very small setups or 1-4GB for general-purpose use. It's important to adjust this parameter based on the workload; OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems may benefit from higher values, whereas OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems might prioritize other settings. Additionally, for systems with hundreds of GBs of RAM, consider setting up huge pages. This setting is also related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`, and it's advisable to conduct benchmarks to fine-tune the parameter for your specific environment. Each PostgreSQL instance will reserve its own memory allocations, so adjustments should be made accordingly for non-dedicated servers."}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'default_statistics_target' knob in PostgreSQL sets the default statistics target for table columns, with a default value of 100. Adjusting this value affects the balance between query planning accuracy and the time taken for ANALYZE operations. For optimal performance, consider setting the value based on your system's size and workload complexity: medium-sized systems may perform well with values around 200, while large systems or those with complex workloads might benefit from increasing it to between 500 and 1000. Higher values improve query planner estimates for complex queries but increase ANALYZE time and storage usage. Note that there is no column-specific override via ALTER TABLE SET STATISTICS, making it important to choose a value that suits your overall database needs."}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimally configure 'max_worker_processes' in PostgreSQL, start by understanding it sets the maximum number of background processes the system can support, with a default of 8. It's crucial to ensure standby servers have matching or higher values. Adjust this parameter in conjunction with related parallel worker settings such as 'max_parallel_workers' and 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather'. For allocation, a balanced approach is to set it to 1 worker per CPU core (e.g., 8 for an 8-core server), ensuring it does not exceed the sum of 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather', 'max_parallel_workers', and other background workers. In scenarios expecting heavily parallelized workloads, consider capping at 2x CPU cores (e.g., 16 for 8 cores) to accommodate, while always leaving room for maintenance tasks. Adjustments should be made based on the specific workload parallelism and available system resources. For example, a 4-core server with moderate parallelism might set this to 4, whereas high parallelism could justify up to 8."}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.

            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            KNOB: max_worker_processes
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimally configure 'max_worker_processes' in PostgreSQL, start by understanding it sets the maximum number of background processes the system can support, with a default of 8. It's crucial to ensure standby servers have matching or higher values. Adjust this parameter in conjunction with related parallel worker settings such as 'max_parallel_workers' and 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather'. For allocation, a balanced approach is to set it to 1 worker per CPU core (e.g., 8 for an 8-core server), ensuring it does not exceed the sum of 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather', 'max_parallel_workers', and other background workers. In scenarios expecting heavily parallelized workloads, consider capping at 2x CPU cores (e.g., 16 for 8 cores) to accommodate, while always leaving room for maintenance tasks. Adjustments should be made based on the specific workload parallelism and available system resources. For example, a 4-core server with moderate parallelism might set this to 4, whereas high parallelism could justify up to 8."}
            HARDWARE INFORMATION: The machine running the dbms has a RAM of 31 GB, a CPU of 12 cores, and a 741 GB HDD drive.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            KNOB: max_wal_size
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'max_wal_size' in PostgreSQL should be set considering both the system's workload and disk space availability. A good starting point is the default value of 1 GB, which serves as a soft limit for WAL growth during automatic checkpoints. For systems with smaller workloads, allocating 1GB or 10% of shared_buffers (whichever is larger) is advisable, scaling up to 4GB or more for high-write systems. It's crucial to ensure that 'max_wal_size' is at least twice the size of the largest transaction. For very active databases, consider setting it to 16GB. Increasing 'max_wal_size' can help ensure that automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout rather than by disk space, though it's important to note that higher values may increase recovery time after a crash. Monitoring WAL growth to adjust 'max_wal_size' dynamically is recommended, taking into account the write volume, checkpoint frequency, and disk I/O capacity. Under heavy load or special circumstances, the soft limit can be exceeded."}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            KNOB: max_wal_size
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'max_wal_size' in PostgreSQL should be set considering both the system's workload and disk space availability. A good starting point is the default value of 1 GB, which serves as a soft limit for WAL growth during automatic checkpoints. For systems with smaller workloads, allocating 1GB or 10% of shared_buffers (whichever is larger) is advisable, scaling up to 4GB or more for high-write systems. It's crucial to ensure that 'max_wal_size' is at least twice the size of the largest transaction. For very active databases, consider setting it to 16GB. Increasing 'max_wal_size' can help ensure that automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout rather than by disk space, though it's important to note that higher values may increase recovery time after a crash. Monitoring WAL growth to adjust 'max_wal_size' dynamically is recommended, taking into account the write volume, checkpoint frequency, and disk I/O capacity. Under heavy load or special circumstances, the soft limit can be exceeded."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'checkpoint_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL sets the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints, with a default value of 5 minutes (300 seconds). It is advisable to adjust this setting based on your workload and recovery needs. Increasing the value (e.g., to 15 minutes) can reduce I/O usage by decreasing the frequency of checkpoints, but may lead to larger I/O spikes and longer recovery times after a crash. Conversely, a lower value (e.g., 5 minutes) results in more frequent checkpoints, which can decrease recovery time but increase I/O overhead. Monitoring `pg_stat_bgwriter` is recommended to fine-tune this parameter according to your system's I/O capacity and crash recovery tolerance. The value can be set in `postgresql.conf` in seconds (e.g., `checkpoint_timeout = 900` for 15 minutes)."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.

If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

Database Management Systems (DBMS) have settings referred to as 'knobs'. Numerical knobs typically have a natural order. However, some 'special' numerical knobs have special values, such as -1 or 0, that break this natural order. When set to a special value, such knob performs a very different function compared to its regular operation, such as disabling a feature. Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,

I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

While higher values (such as 0.7–0.9) can be considered to further smooth out I/O activity over larger periods, especially on development instances where it might be set to '0.9', the primary recommendation is to adhere to the default or slightly adjusted values based on specific storage latency considerations (e.g., 0.8 for SSDs, 0.7 for HDDs). It's important to note that if this setting is used for feeding non-streaming replicas, keeping it within a low percentage is advisable."}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

            KNOB: shared_preload_libraries
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `shared_preload_libraries` knob in PostgreSQL is used to specify one or more shared libraries (comma-separated, with optional double quotes for names containing whitespace or commas) that need to be preloaded at server startup. This is essential for libraries requiring postmaster-start operations, such as shared memory allocation (e.g., `pg_stat_statements`). However, it slightly increases new process startup time, even if the libraries are unused, and requires a server restart (`pg_ctl restart`) for any modifications to take effect. This makes it unsuitable for temporary debugging purposes; instead, consider using `session_preload_libraries` for such cases. On Windows, while preloading doesn't reduce per-process startup time, it remains crucial for postmaster-start operations. To configure, edit the `postgresql.conf` file by specifying the required extensions (e.g., `'pg_stat_statements, auto_explain'`) under the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter. Ensure the extensions you plan to use are included, with `pg_stat_statements` or `pg_stat_monitor` being common choices."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

            KNOB: shared_preload_libraries
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `shared_preload_libraries` knob in PostgreSQL is used to specify one or more shared libraries (comma-separated, with optional double quotes for names containing whitespace or commas) that need to be preloaded at server startup. This is essential for libraries requiring postmaster-start operations, such as shared memory allocation (e.g., `pg_stat_statements`). However, it slightly increases new process startup time, even if the libraries are unused, and requires a server restart (`pg_ctl restart`) for any modifications to take effect. This makes it unsuitable for temporary debugging purposes; instead, consider using `session_preload_libraries` for such cases. On Windows, while preloading doesn't reduce per-process startup time, it remains crucial for postmaster-start operations. To configure, edit the `postgresql.conf` file by specifying the required extensions (e.g., `'pg_stat_statements, auto_explain'`) under the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter. Ensure the extensions you plan to use are included, with `pg_stat_statements` or `pg_stat_monitor` being common choices."}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}
<\example>
<example>
KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

            KNOB: hash_mem_multiplier
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `hash_mem_multiplier` in PostgreSQL should be adjusted based on the available system memory and the specific workload demands. The default value is 1.0, but it can be increased to a range of 1.5-2.0 for mixed workloads or even higher (2.0-8.0+) when `work_mem` is already ≥40MB to minimize spilling and alleviate memory pressure. This adjustment helps in optimizing performance for hash-based operations such as joins and aggregates. It's crucial to monitor the system's performance, possibly using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, to ensure the setting meets the workload requirements without causing memory starvation for other operations."}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_indexscan' parameter in PostgreSQL, which is set to 'on' by default, controls the query planner's use of index-scan and index-only-scan operations. These operations can significantly enhance performance for indexed queries by minimizing the need for full-table scans. While it's generally advisable to keep this setting enabled for most workloads, there may be scenarios, such as when accessing a large portion of the table's rows (e.g., more than 30%) or dealing with poorly selective indexes, where disabling it could lead to better performance by favoring sequential scans. It's recommended to benchmark different settings using 'EXPLAIN ANALYZE' to compare query execution plans before making any adjustments. Note that the 30% threshold is a heuristic and the optimal setting may vary based on specific query patterns and data distribution."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            KNOB: work_mem
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': 'To optimize PostgreSQL performance, adjust the `work_mem` parameter based on your workload type and system resources. For OLTP workloads, allocate **4MB–16MB per connection**, and for complex queries (e.g., sorts/joins), consider **64MB–256MB+**, ensuring the total memory usage (`work_mem × max_connections`) does not exceed **25% of RAM** to prevent swapping. For example, with 8GB RAM and 100 connections, start with **8MB** (`(8GB × 0.25) / 100 ≈ 20MB max per connection`). Monitor query performance and adjust accordingly. Be cautious of setting the value too high, as it may lead to memory contention or destabilize node throughput with many concurrent operations. The default value is 4MB, which is generally too low for modern systems; starting at 16MB is recommended for most scenarios. Remember, hash-based operations may require additional memory via `hash_mem_multiplier`. Always base your adjustments on actual query performance and system monitoring.'}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            KNOB: lock_timeout
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure the 'lock_timeout' setting in PostgreSQL effectively, it's crucial to understand its function: it aborts statements that wait longer than the specified time to acquire a lock, with the default value being 0 (disabled). The value is interpreted in milliseconds if no unit is provided (e.g., 5000 for 5 seconds), and this setting applies to each lock attempt, covering both explicit and implicit locks. For optimal performance across different workloads, consider the following guidelines: for OLTP systems, a starting range of 100ms-300ms is recommended to minimize long waits; for reporting queries, a range of 1s-10s may be more appropriate; and for maintenance tasks, setting it between 30s-5min or disabling it (0) could be beneficial, depending on the need to balance lock contention avoidance with the necessity for query completion. Always adjust these values based on actual observations of lock contention and query performance to fine-tune your PostgreSQL environment."}

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}
<\example>
<example>
KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

This parameter can be adjusted to influence the planner's preference for index scans based on your storage type. For SSDs, it is recommended to lower the value to around 1.1, reflecting their faster random access capabilities compared to traditional HDDs.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints.

If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            SUGGESTION: {'suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_naptime' parameter in PostgreSQL sets the minimum delay between autovacuum runs on a database. It is recommended to configure this parameter in postgresql.conf or via the server command line, with a default value of **60 seconds (1 minute)**. While a typical value might range between **1–5 seconds** for systems requiring more frequent vacuuming, especially under busy conditions, it's crucial to adjust this setting based on the specific workload and monitoring outcomes to ensure optimal performance.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".

Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.

Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.

Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

For tables with moderate churn, a common starting point is **0.2% (0.002)**, but for large or heavily updated tables, consider lowering it to **0.1% (0.001)** or even **0.05% (0.0005)** to trigger vacuums more aggressively, while balancing overhead.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers.

For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.

Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

This setting does not affect the amount of physical RAM used by queries. Alternatively, allocating 50-75% of your system's total RAM (e.g., 8GB for a 12GB system) can balance PostgreSQL's assumption of available cache with OS/buffer needs, adhering to typical recommendations that range from half to three-quarters of RAM.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value.

Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value.

Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

Database Management Systems (DBMS) have settings referred to as 'knobs'. Numerical knobs typically have a natural order. However, some 'special' numerical knobs have special values, such as -1 or 0, that break this natural order. When set to a special value, such knob performs a very different function compared to its regular operation, such as disabling a feature. Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob. Let us think step by step, please classify a knob of postgresas a 'special knob' and provide the RESULT in JSON format.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            KNOB: maintenance_work_mem
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `maintenance_work_mem` knob in PostgreSQL should be set higher than `work_mem` to optimize maintenance operations such as VACUUM and CREATE INDEX, with a default value of **64MB**. For systems with large RAM resources and significant write operations, it is advisable to increase this value to speed up maintenance tasks, keeping in mind that each autovacuum worker might use this amount of memory unless directly controlled by `autovacuum_work_mem`. A general guideline is to allocate **5% to 10% of total system RAM** (e.g., **512MB to 1GB on a 16GB system**) for typical maintenance operations, as larger values may yield diminishing returns. However, for specialized bulk loads or very large indexes, adjusting higher (e.g., **4GB**) may be beneficial. It's crucial to set this value cautiously to avoid excessive memory allocation when multiplied by `autovacuum_max_workers`."}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

It is enabled by default and only takes effect if hash-join plans are also enabled. For optimal performance, consider enabling it ('on') specifically for hash joins involving large tables (e.g., >1GB) to leverage parallel workers, which can be typically set to 2-4x the CPU cores. However, it may be beneficial to disable it ('off') for small tables or systems with limited resources to avoid unnecessary overhead."}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.

Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".

Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            KNOB: bgwriter_flush_after
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance through the 'bgwriter_flush_after' knob, it is recommended to adjust this setting based on your system's specific workload and I/O capacity. The default value is typically 512 kB, which forces the OS to write data to storage after accumulating 512kB of dirty data, aiming to reduce fsync stalls and improve transaction latency. However, for systems with light workloads or those utilizing SSDs, a smaller value (e.g., 64–128 kB) may be more beneficial. Conversely, for systems experiencing heavy write loads or using HDDs, a larger value (e.g., 512–1024 kB) can help reduce I/O overhead by delaying flushes. Note that performance may degrade for workloads that fall between the shared_buffers and the OS page cache size."}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:

However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

While this increases WAL volume, adjusting the checkpoint interval can mitigate overhead. Disabling it (`full_page_writes = off`) can improve performance if you have a battery-backed write cache or a reliable filesystem (like ZFS with atomic writes), but doing so risks unrecoverable or silent corruption, similar to but less severe than turning off `fsync`.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `full_page_writes` knob in PostgreSQL is enabled by default to ensure crash recovery by writing the entire disk page to WAL during its first post-checkpoint modification, preventing partial page corruption. While this increases WAL volume, adjusting the checkpoint interval can mitigate overhead. Disabling it (`full_page_writes = off`) can improve performance if you have a battery-backed write cache or a reliable filesystem (like ZFS with atomic writes), but doing so risks unrecoverable or silent corruption, similar to but less severe than turning off `fsync`. It's generally safe to disable on modern storage with power loss protection, but always benchmark and verify durability requirements before making changes."}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.

I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

            SUGGESTION: {'summary_suggestion': {'description': "The `autovacuum_work_mem` parameter should be set to a maximum of **1GB** for dead tuple collection, as allocating more memory beyond this limit provides no additional benefit. A common starting point for moderate workloads is **256MB**, but it can be adjusted higher (up to 1GB) if autovacuum processes are slow and additional RAM is available. It's important to ensure that this setting does not compete with `work_mem` or `maintenance_work_mem`. For example, on a system with 16GB of RAM, setting `autovacuum_work_mem` to 512MB is considered reasonable. The default value is often too low at 1MB, and if set to -1, it defaults to the `maintenance_work_mem` setting."}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            KNOB: autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` parameter sets the cost delay for automatic VACUUM operations, with a default value of 2ms when no unit is specified. It can be adjusted per-table via storage parameters or set to -1 to fall back to `vacuum_cost_delay`. For optimal performance, consider starting with the default value and adjust lower (e.g., 2–10ms) for aggressive vacuuming on high-I/O systems or higher (e.g., 50–100ms) to reduce I/O impact on latency-sensitive workloads, ensuring a balance between vacuum efficiency and system load.'}
            HARDWARE INFORMATION: The machine running the dbms has a RAM of 31 GB, a CPU of 12 cores, and a 741 GB HDD drive.
            JSON RESULT TEMPLATE:
            {
                "suggested_values": [], // these should be exact values with a unit if needed (allowable units: KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min)
                "min_value": null,      // change it if there is a hint about the minimum value in SUGGESTIONS
                "max_value": null      // change it if there is a hint about the maximum value in SUGGESTIONS, it should be larger than min_value

Database Management Systems (DBMS) have settings referred to as 'knobs'. Numerical knobs typically have a natural order. However, some 'special' numerical knobs have special values, such as -1 or 0, that break this natural order. When set to a special value, such knob performs a very different function compared to its regular operation, such as disabling a feature. Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob. Let us think step by step, please classify a knob of postgresas a 'special knob' and provide the RESULT in JSON format.
