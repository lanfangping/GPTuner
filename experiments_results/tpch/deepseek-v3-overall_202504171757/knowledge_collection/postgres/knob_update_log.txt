shared_buffers
TUNING_SUGGESTION:
{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `shared_buffers` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to allocate memory for shared memory buffers. For dedicated servers with at least 1GB of RAM, a recommended starting value is 25% of the system memory, with a maximum of up to 40% for optimal performance, ensuring not to exceed 8GB in any scenario. Smaller systems should allocate less to preserve OS resources, with a minimum of 128MB for very small setups or 1-4GB for general-purpose use. It's important to adjust this parameter based on the workload; OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems may benefit from higher values, whereas OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems might prioritize other settings. Additionally, for systems with hundreds of GBs of RAM, consider setting up huge pages. This setting is also related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`, and it's advisable to conduct benchmarks to fine-tune the parameter for your specific environment. Each PostgreSQL instance will reserve its own memory allocations, so adjustments should be made accordingly for non-dedicated servers."}

In scenarios expecting heavily parallelized workloads, consider capping at 2x CPU cores (e.g., 16 for 8 cores) to accommodate, while always leaving room for maintenance tasks.

It's crucial to ensure that 'max_wal_size' is at least twice the size of the largest transaction. For very active databases, consider setting it to 16GB. Increasing 'max_wal_size' can help ensure that automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout rather than by disk space, though it's important to note that higher values may increase recovery time after a crash.

{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure the `wal_sync_method` in PostgreSQL, select the most reliable and performant method available for your operating system, considering options such as `fdatasync` (commonly the default on Linux and FreeBSD systems), `fsync`, `fsync_writethrough`, `open_datasync`, and `open_sync`. Each method offers different trade-offs between performance and crash-safety. It's important to benchmark these options (e.g., `fdatasync` typically has sync times of ~0.1–10ms, varying with hardware) to determine the best fit for your setup. Prioritize data safety unless operating in a latency-critical environment, where performance might take precedence. Note that the default setting may not be optimal for all configurations, and specific sync times can vary significantly between storage hardware types, such as SSDs/NVMe being faster than HDDs."}

This feature is particularly beneficial for queries that involve large table scans with multiple workers (typically scaling with max_parallel_workers_per_gather, often defaulting to 2). While it is generally recommended to keep this setting enabled ('on') for scenarios that benefit from parallel execution, such as large table scans, it may be advisable to disable it ('off') for OLTP workloads characterized by small, frequent queries to minimize overhead.

However, this comes with the risk of data loss if not backed by external recreation methods. Disabling `fsync` is particularly discouraged in production environments due to the high risk of data loss, but may be considered in testing environments where performance gains are prioritized over data durability. The performance improvement from disabling `fsync` can be substantial, potentially doubling write throughput, though the exact impact varies by workload and hardware.'}

The default value is typically 512 kB, which forces the OS to write data to storage after accumulating 512kB of dirty data, aiming to reduce fsync stalls and improve transaction latency. However, for systems with light workloads or those utilizing SSDs, a smaller value (e.g., 64–128 kB) may be more beneficial. Conversely, for systems experiencing heavy write loads or using HDDs, a larger value (e.g., 512–1024 kB) can help reduce I/O overhead by delaying flushes. Note that performance may degrade for workloads that fall between the shared_buffers and the OS page cache size."}

full_page_writes

{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `full_page_writes` knob in PostgreSQL is enabled by default to ensure crash recovery by writing the entire disk page to WAL during its first post-checkpoint modification, preventing partial page corruption. While this increases WAL volume, adjusting the checkpoint interval can mitigate overhead. Disabling it (`full_page_writes = off`) can improve performance if you have a battery-backed write cache or a reliable filesystem (like ZFS with atomic writes), but doing so risks unrecoverable or silent corruption, similar to but less severe than turning off `fsync`. It's generally safe to disable on modern storage with power loss protection, but always benchmark and verify durability requirements before making changes."}

{'summary_suggestion': {'description': "The `autovacuum_work_mem` parameter should be set to a maximum of **1GB** for dead tuple collection, as allocating more memory beyond this limit provides no additional benefit. A common starting point for moderate workloads is **256MB**, but it can be adjusted higher (up to 1GB) if autovacuum processes are slow and additional RAM is available. It's important to ensure that this setting does not compete with `work_mem` or `maintenance_work_mem`. For example, on a system with 16GB of RAM, setting `autovacuum_work_mem` to 512MB is considered reasonable. The default value is often too low at 1MB, and if set to -1, it defaults to the `maintenance_work_mem` setting."}}
