Summerize the description for knob 'checkpoint_timeout' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as seconds. The valid range is between 30 seconds and one day. The default is five minutes (5min). Increasing this parameter can increase the amount of time needed for crash recovery. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:
 {'boot_val': '300', 'category': 'Write-Ahead Log / Checkpoints', 'context': 'sighup', 'enumvals': None, 'extra_desc': None, 'max_val': '86400', 'min_val': '30', 'name': 'checkpoint_timeout', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': '300', 'setting': '300', 'short_desc': 'Sets the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints.', 'source': 'default', 'sourcefile': None, 'sourceline': None, 'unit': 's', 'vartype': 'integer'}
 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value for the 'checkpoint_timeout' knob in postgres, you can use the SET command in SQL with a value of your choice in seconds, such as 5 minutes (300 seconds) for a faster checkpoint frequency or longer intervals like 15 minutes (900 seconds) for a less aggressive approach.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Normally you want to raise it (e.g. ‘15min’). The larger the parameter is, you may experience larger I/O spikes (which may be smoothed out tuning checkpoint_completion_target and bgwriter activity) and the larger recovery time you may experience after a database crash. However, more frequent checkpoints create in aggregation more I/O, so raising it typically improves I/O usage.

 Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format.:
 {
     "gpt_suggestion": null ,   // if there is a contradiction, remove the contradictory part, else return the corresponding original suggestion.

                Summerize the description for knob 'force_parallel_mode' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Allows the use of parallel queries for testing purposes even in cases where no performance benefit is expected. The allowed values of force_parallel_mode are off (use parallel mode only when it is expected to improve performance), on (force parallel query for all queries for which it is thought to be safe), and regress (like on, but with additional behavior changes as explained below).
More specifically, setting this value to on will add a Gather node to the top of any query plan for which this appears to be safe, so that the query runs inside of a parallel worker. Even when a parallel worker is not available or cannot be used, operations such as starting a subtransaction that would be prohibited in a parallel query context will be prohibited unless the planner believes that this will cause the query to fail. If failures or unexpected results occur when this option is set, some functions used by the query may need to be marked PARALLEL UNSAFE (or, possibly, PARALLEL RESTRICTED).
Setting this value to regress has all of the same effects as setting it to on plus some additional effects that are intended to facilitate automated regression testing. Normally, messages from a parallel worker include a context line indicating that, but a setting of regress suppresses this line so that the output is the same as in non-parallel execution. Also, the Gather nodes added to plans by this setting are hidden in EXPLAIN output so that the output matches what would be obtained if this setting were turned off.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:
 {'boot_val': '200', 'category': 'Resource Usage / Cost-Based Vacuum Delay', 'context': 'user', 'enumvals': None, 'extra_desc': None, 'max_val': '10000', 'min_val': '1', 'name': 'vacuum_cost_limit', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': '200', 'setting': '200', 'short_desc': 'Vacuum cost amount available before napping.', 'source': 'default', 'sourcefile': None, 'sourceline': None, 'unit': None, 'vartype': 'integer'}
 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value for the knob 'vacuum_cost_limit' in Postgres, consider setting it to a value between 10 and 100, taking into account the amount of available memory and desired performance levels for vacuum operations.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Normally you want to raise it (e.g. ‘15min’). The larger the parameter is, you may experience larger I/O spikes (which may be smoothed out tuning checkpoint_completion_target and bgwriter activity) and the larger recovery time you may experience after a database crash. However, more frequent checkpoints create in aggregation more I/O, so raising it typically improves I/O usage.

 Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format.:
 {
     "gpt_suggestion": null ,   // if there is a contradiction, remove the contradictory part, else return the corresponding original suggestion.
     "web_suggestion": null   // if there is a contradiction, remove the contradictory part, else return the corresponding original suggestion.

Summerize the description for knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Specifies the cost delay value that will be used in automatic VACUUM operations. If -1 is specified, the regular vacuum_cost_delay value will be used. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. The default value is 2 milliseconds. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

                Summerize the description for knob 'wal_level' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                wal_level determines how much information is written to the WAL. The default value is replica, which writes enough data to support WAL archiving and replication, including running read-only queries on a standby server. minimal removes all logging except the information required to recover from a crash or immediate shutdown. Finally, logical adds information necessary to support logical decoding. Each level includes the information logged at all lower levels. This parameter can only be set at server start.
The minimal level generates the least WAL volume. It logs no row information for permanent relations in transactions that create or rewrite them. This can make operations much faster (see Section 14.4.7). Operations that initiate this optimization include:
But minimal WAL does not contain enough information to reconstruct the data from a base backup and the WAL logs, so replica or higher must be used to enable WAL archiving (archive_mode) and streaming replication.
In logical level, the same information is logged as with replica, plus information needed to allow extracting logical change sets from the WAL. Using a level of logical will increase the WAL volume, particularly if many tables are configured for REPLICA IDENTITY FULL and many UPDATE and DELETE statements are executed.
In releases prior to 9.6, this parameter also allowed the values archive and hot_standby. These are still accepted but mapped to replica.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:
 {'boot_val': '0.9', 'category': 'Write-Ahead Log / Checkpoints', 'context': 'sighup', 'enumvals': None, 'extra_desc': None, 'max_val': '1', 'min_val': '0', 'name': 'checkpoint_completion_target', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': '0.9', 'setting': '0.9', 'short_desc': 'Time spent flushing dirty buffers during checkpoint, as fraction of checkpoint interval.', 'source': 'default', 'sourcefile': None, 'sourceline': None, 'unit': None, 'vartype': 'real'}
 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value for the knob 'checkpoint_completion_target' in Postgres, the recommended range is typically between 0.5 and 0.9, with a default value of 0.5.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Raise it to smooth I/O activity of checkpoints over larger periods of time. If you rely on this value for feeding non-streaming replicas, it is recommended to keep this within a low percentage. On development instances, it is usual to set it to ‘0.9’.

Summerize the description for knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Specifies a fraction of the table size to add to autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold when deciding whether to trigger a VACUUM. The default is 0.2 (20% of table size). This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

DESCRIPTION:
As long as WAL disk usage stays below this setting, old WAL files are always recycled for future use at a checkpoint, rather than removed. This can be used to ensure that enough WAL space is reserved to handle spikes in WAL usage, for example when running large batch jobs. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as megabytes. The default is 80 MB. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

Summerize the description for knob 'transaction_read_only' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
This parameter reflects the current transaction's read-only status. At the beginning of each transaction, it is set to the current value of default_transaction_read_only. Any subsequent attempt to change it is equivalent to a SET TRANSACTION command.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value for the 'transaction_read_only' knob in postgres, you can use the SET command in SQL to set it to a boolean value of either  TRUE (1) for read-only transactions or FALSE (0) for read-write transactions.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 None

DESCRIPTION:
Whenever more than this amount of data has been written by the background writer, attempt to force the OS to issue these writes to the underlying storage. Doing so will limit the amount of dirty data in the kernel's page cache, reducing the likelihood of stalls when an fsync is issued at the end of a checkpoint, or when the OS writes data back in larger batches in the background. Often that will result in greatly reduced transaction latency, but there also are some cases, especially with workloads that are bigger than shared_buffers, but smaller than the OS's page cache, where performance might degrade. This setting may have no effect on some platforms. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. The valid range is between 0, which disables forced writeback, and 2MB. The default is 512kB on Linux, 0 elsewhere. (If BLCKSZ is not 8kB, the default and maximum values scale proportionally to it.)

Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections from standby servers or streaming base backup clients (i.e., the maximum number of simultaneously running WAL sender processes). The default is 10. The value 0 means replication is disabled. Abrupt disconnection of a streaming client might leave an orphaned connection slot behind until a timeout is reached, so this parameter should be set slightly higher than the maximum number of expected clients so disconnected clients can immediately reconnect. This parameter can only be set at server start. Also, wal_level must be set to replica or higher to allow connections from standby servers.
When running a standby server, you must set this parameter to the same or higher value than on the master server. Otherwise, queries will not be allowed in the standby server.

If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

OFFICIAL_DOC:
{'boot_val': '10', 'category': 'Replication / Sending Servers', 'context': 'postmaster', 'enumvals': None, 'extra_desc': None, 'max_val': '262143', 'min_val': '0', 'name': 'max_wal_senders', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': '10', 'setting': '10', 'short_desc': 'Sets the maximum number of simultaneously running WAL sender processes.', 'source': 'default', 'sourcefile': None, 'sourceline': None, 'unit': None, 'vartype': 'integer'}

Now let's think step by step and give me the result in legal json format:
    {
        "gpt_suggestion": null ,   // if the original suggestion is empty, return null, else return the corresponding answer.
        "web_suggestion": null,  // if the original suggestion is empty, return null, else return the corresponding answer.

DESCRIPTION:
Enables timing of database I/O calls. This parameter is off by default, because it will repeatedly query the operating system for the current time, which may cause significant overhead on some platforms. You can use the pg_test_timing tool to measure the overhead of timing on your system. I/O timing information is displayed in pg_stat_database, in the output of EXPLAIN when the BUFFERS option is used, and by pg_stat_statements. Only superusers can change this setting.

DESCRIPTION:
Specifies the minimum delay between autovacuum runs on any given database. In each round the daemon examines the database and issues VACUUM and ANALYZE commands as needed for tables in that database. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as seconds. The default is one minute (1min). This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the base maximum amount of memory to be used by a query operation (such as a sort or hash table) before writing to temporary disk files. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as kilobytes. The default value is four megabytes (4MB). Note that a complex query might perform several sort and hash operations at the same time, with each operation generally being allowed to use as much memory as this value specifies before it starts to write data into temporary files. Also, several running sessions could be doing such operations concurrently. Therefore, the total memory used could be many times the value of work_mem; it is necessary to keep this fact in mind when choosing the value. Sort operations are used for ORDER BY, DISTINCT, and merge joins. Hash tables are used in hash joins, hash-based aggregation, and hash-based processing of IN subqueries.
Hash-based operations are generally more sensitive to memory availability than equivalent sort-based operations. The memory limit for a hash table is computed by multiplying work_mem by hash_mem_multiplier. This makes it possible for hash-based operations to use an amount of memory that exceeds the usual work_mem base amount.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value for the knob 'work_mem' in PostgreSQL, you can use the formula: Recommended value = total_memory_available / (max_connections * work_mem_percentage).
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Setting this parameter requires inspecting the memory usage in your queries. If this value falls short in a query execution, the engine will use memory and disk, impacting on its performance. Although, keeping this value too large, could destabilize the node throughput when dealing with too many concurrent operations. For OLTP queries that do not require complex joins or sorting lots of data, this value may be in the low MBs. For OLAP-style queries, and few concurrent queries, it may grow into the GB range. Multiply by max_connections * N (being N a small single-digit number) to estimate the maximum amount of total memory potential consumed by Postgres process. Adjust based on it. If possible, raise the default value.The default value for work_mem is 4MB. This is generally acknowledged to be too small for most modern systems. For example, Christophe Pettus suggests that 16MB is a good starting point for most people. So it’s pretty normal to at least consider increasing it. work_mem = <1-5% of RAM>

                Summerize the description for knob 'shared_buffers' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers. The default is typically 128 megabytes (128MB), but might be less if your kernel settings will not support it (as determined during initdb). This setting must be at least 128 kilobytes. However, settings significantly higher than the minimum are usually needed for good performance. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. (Non-default values of BLCKSZ change the minimum value.) This parameter can only be set at server start.
If you have a dedicated database server with 1GB or more of RAM, a reasonable starting value for shared_buffers is 25% of the memory in your system. There are some workloads where even larger settings for shared_buffers are effective, but because PostgreSQL also relies on the operating system cache, it is unlikely that an allocation of more than 40% of RAM to shared_buffers will work better than a smaller amount. Larger settings for shared_buffers usually require a corresponding increase in max_wal_size, in order to spread out the process of writing large quantities of new or changed data over a longer period of time.
On systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage of RAM is appropriate, so as to leave adequate space for the operating system.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 The recommended way to set the value for the 'shared_buffers' knob in PostgreSQL is to allocate 25% of total available memory, up to a maximum of 2GB, for optimal performance.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Conventional wisdom suggests 25% of the RAM. Do your own benchmarks varying this parameter. If you are into hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. Adjust accordingly for non-dedicated servers, considering that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations. This variable is in direct relation with OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.

DESCRIPTION:
Sets the default statistics target for table columns without a column-specific target set via ALTER TABLE SET STATISTICS. Larger values increase the time needed to do ANALYZE, but might improve the quality of the planner's estimates. The default is 100. For more information on the use of statistics by the PostgreSQL query planner, refer to Section 14.2.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies the maximum amount of memory to be used by each autovacuum worker process. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as kilobytes. It defaults to -1, indicating that the value of maintenance_work_mem should be used instead. The setting has no effect on the behavior of VACUUM when run in other contexts. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.
For the collection of dead tuple identifiers, autovacuum is only able to utilize up to a maximum of 1GB of memory, so setting autovacuum_work_mem to a value higher than that has no effect on the number of dead tuples that autovacuum can collect while scanning a table.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

Summerize the description for knob 'checkpoint_flush_after' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Whenever more than this amount of data has been written while performing a checkpoint, attempt to force the OS to issue these writes to the underlying storage. Doing so will limit the amount of dirty data in the kernel's page cache, reducing the likelihood of stalls when an fsync is issued at the end of the checkpoint, or when the OS writes data back in larger batches in the background. Often that will result in greatly reduced transaction latency, but there also are some cases, especially with workloads that are bigger than shared_buffers, but smaller than the OS's page cache, where performance might degrade. This setting may have no effect on some platforms. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. The valid range is between 0, which disables forced writeback, and 2MB. The default is 256kB on Linux, 0 elsewhere. (If BLCKSZ is not 8kB, the default and maximum values scale proportionally to it.) This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

                Summerize the description for knob 'wal_buffers' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                The amount of shared memory used for WAL data that has not yet been written to disk. The default setting of -1 selects a size equal to 1/32nd (about 3%) of shared_buffers, but not less than 64kB nor more than the size of one WAL segment, typically 16MB. This value can be set manually if the automatic choice is too large or too small, but any positive value less than 32kB will be treated as 32kB. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as WAL blocks, that is XLOG_BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. This parameter can only be set at server start.
The contents of the WAL buffers are written out to disk at every transaction commit, so extremely large values are unlikely to provide a significant benefit. However, setting this value to at least a few megabytes can improve write performance on a busy server where many clients are committing at once. The auto-tuning selected by the default setting of -1 should give reasonable results in most cases.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies the maximum age (in multixacts) that a table's pg_class.relminmxid field can attain before a VACUUM operation is forced to prevent multixact ID wraparound within the table. Note that the system will launch autovacuum processes to prevent wraparound even when autovacuum is otherwise disabled.
Vacuuming multixacts also allows removal of old files from the pg_multixact/members and pg_multixact/offsets subdirectories, which is why the default is a relatively low 400 million multixacts. This parameter can only be set at server start, but the setting can be reduced for individual tables by changing table storage parameters. For more information see Section 24.1.5.1.

Summerize the description for knob 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Specifies a fraction of the table size to add to autovacuum_analyze_threshold when deciding whether to trigger an ANALYZE. The default is 0.1 (10% of table size). This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies the maximum age (in transactions) that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can attain before a VACUUM operation is forced to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. Note that the system will launch autovacuum processes to prevent wraparound even when autovacuum is otherwise disabled.
Vacuum also allows removal of old files from the pg_xact subdirectory, which is why the default is a relatively low 200 million transactions. This parameter can only be set at server start, but the setting can be reduced for individual tables by changing table storage parameters. For more information see Section 24.1.5.

                Summerize the description for knob 'hot_standby_feedback' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies whether or not a hot standby will send feedback to the primary or upstream standby about queries currently executing on the standby. This parameter can be used to eliminate query cancels caused by cleanup records, but can cause database bloat on the primary for some workloads. Feedback messages will not be sent more frequently than once per wal_receiver_status_interval. The default value is off. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.
If cascaded replication is in use the feedback is passed upstream until it eventually reaches the primary. Standbys make no other use of feedback they receive other than to pass upstream.
This setting does not override the behavior of old_snapshot_threshold on the primary; a snapshot on the standby which exceeds the primary's age threshold can become invalid, resulting in cancellation of transactions on the standby. This is because old_snapshot_threshold is intended to provide an absolute limit on the time which dead rows can contribute to bloat, which would otherwise be violated because of the configuration of a standby.

Summerize the description for knob 'effective_cache_size' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Sets the planner's assumption about the effective size of the disk cache that is available to a single query. This is factored into estimates of the cost of using an index; a higher value makes it more likely index scans will be used, a lower value makes it more likely sequential scans will be used. When setting this parameter you should consider both PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the portion of the kernel's disk cache that will be used for PostgreSQL data files, though some data might exist in both places. Also, take into account the expected number of concurrent queries on different tables, since they will have to share the available space. This parameter has no effect on the size of shared memory allocated by PostgreSQL, nor does it reserve kernel disk cache; it is used only for estimation purposes. The system also does not assume data remains in the disk cache between queries. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. The default is 4 gigabytes (4GB). (If BLCKSZ is not 8kB, the default value scales proportionally to it.)

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value for the 'effective_cache_size' knob in Postgres, calculate 50% of your total system memory for machines with less than 4GB of RAM, or allocate 25% of system memory for machines with more than 4GB of RAM, up to a maximum of 2GB.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Set it to (approximately): system RAM - (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) * 1.1, or a lower value if the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL. Note that this setting does not affect the amount of physical RAM used by queries.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Causes the duration of each completed statement to be logged if the statement ran for at least the specified amount of time. For example, if you set it to 250ms then all SQL statements that run 250ms or longer will be logged. Enabling this parameter can be helpful in tracking down unoptimized queries in your applications. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. Setting this to zero prints all statement durations. -1 (the default) disables logging statement durations. Only superusers can change this setting.
This overrides log_min_duration_sample, meaning that queries with duration exceeding this setting are not subject to sampling and are always logged.
For clients using extended query protocol, durations of the Parse, Bind, and Execute steps are logged independently.
When using this option together with log_statement, the text of statements that are logged because of log_statement will not be repeated in the duration log message. If you are not using syslog, it is recommended that you log the PID or session ID using log_line_prefix so that you can link the statement message to the later duration message using the process ID or session ID.

If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

                Summerize the description for knob 'effective_io_concurrency' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that PostgreSQL expects can be executed simultaneously. Raising this value will increase the number of I/O operations that any individual PostgreSQL session attempts to initiate in parallel. The allowed range is 1 to 1000, or zero to disable issuance of asynchronous I/O requests. Currently, this setting only affects bitmap heap scans.
For magnetic drives, a good starting point for this setting is the number of separate drives comprising a RAID 0 stripe or RAID 1 mirror being used for the database. (For RAID 5 the parity drive should not be counted.) However, if the database is often busy with multiple queries issued in concurrent sessions, lower values may be sufficient to keep the disk array busy. A value higher than needed to keep the disks busy will only result in extra CPU overhead. SSDs and other memory-based storage can often process many concurrent requests, so the best value might be in the hundreds.
Asynchronous I/O depends on an effective posix_fadvise function, which some operating systems lack. If the function is not present then setting this parameter to anything but zero will result in an error. On some operating systems (e.g., Solaris), the function is present but does not actually do anything.
The default is 1 on supported systems, otherwise 0. This value can be overridden for tables in a particular tablespace by setting the tablespace parameter of the same name (see ALTER TABLESPACE).

                Specifies the maximum number of replication slots (see Section 26.2.6) that the server can support. The default is 10. This parameter can only be set at server start. Setting it to a lower value than the number of currently existing replication slots will prevent the server from starting. Also, wal_level must be set to replica or higher to allow replication slots to be used.
On the subscriber side, specifies how many replication origins (see Chapter 49) can be tracked simultaneously, effectively limiting how many logical replication subscriptions can be created on the server. Setting it a lower value than the current number of tracked replication origins (reflected in pg_replication_origin_status, not pg_replication_origin) will prevent the server from starting.

Summerize the description for knob 'enable_indexonlyscan' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Enables or disables the query planner's use of index-only-scan plan types (see Section 11.9). The default is on. The enable_indexscan setting must also be enabled to have the query planner consider index-only-scans.
SENTECNCE:

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:
 {'boot_val': 'on', 'category': 'Query Tuning / Planner Method Configuration', 'context': 'user', 'enumvals': None, 'extra_desc': None, 'max_val': None, 'min_val': None, 'name': 'enable_indexonlyscan', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': 'on', 'setting': 'on', 'short_desc': "Enables the planner's use of index-only-scan plans.", 'source': 'default', 'sourcefile': None, 'sourceline': None, 'unit': None, 'vartype': 'bool'}
 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the value for the knob 'enable_indexonlyscan' in Postgres, you can either enable or disable it by setting it to 1 for ON or 0 for OFF.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 None

 Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format.:
 {
     "gpt_suggestion": null ,   // if there is a contradiction, remove the contradictory part, else return the corresponding original suggestion.
     "web_suggestion": null   // if there is a contradiction, remove the contradictory part, else return the corresponding original suggestion.
 }

I will give you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres. Your job is to find contradictions between the given suggestions. If there is contradictory information between certain suggestions, especially the contradictions of values, keep the information provided by the higher-priority suggestion and only remove the contradictory information provided by the lower-priority suggestion. Do not remove the other information. The priority is defined in sequence as "manual_suggestion, web_suggestion, gpt_suggestion" from higher to lower. So manual_suggestion should not be changed. If there is contradiction within the same suggestion, keep it.  Try to make your summary encapsulates information from the three suggestions as much as possible except from the contradictory parts.    
THREE SUGGESTIONS:

Now let's think step by step, and give me the result in legal json format.:

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.
