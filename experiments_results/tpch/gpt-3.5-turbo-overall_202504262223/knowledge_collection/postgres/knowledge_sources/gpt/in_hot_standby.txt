To set the value for the 'in_hot_standby' knob in Postgres, you will need to set it to 'on' if you want the server to be in hot standby mode, or 'off' if you do not want it to be in hot standby mode; typically, this is done by setting the parameter in the postgresql.conf file to either 'on' or 'off'.
