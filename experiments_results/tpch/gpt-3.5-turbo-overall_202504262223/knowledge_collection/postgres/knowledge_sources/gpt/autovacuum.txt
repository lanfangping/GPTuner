To set the value for the 'autovacuum' knob in Postgres, adjust the autovacuum_vacuum_threshold parameter to your desired table size threshold (usually around 50-100), and set the autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor to determine the percentage of dead tuples to trigger vacuuming (commonly set between 0.1-0.2).
