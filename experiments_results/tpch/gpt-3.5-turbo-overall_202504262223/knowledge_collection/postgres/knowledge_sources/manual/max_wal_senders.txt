The parameter 'max_wal_senders' determines the maximum number of concurrent connections from standby servers or streaming base backup clients, with a default value of 10 and a requirement for setting slightly higher than the maximum expected clients to facilitate reconnections; it must be set to the same or higher value on the standby server compared to the master server to allow queries.
