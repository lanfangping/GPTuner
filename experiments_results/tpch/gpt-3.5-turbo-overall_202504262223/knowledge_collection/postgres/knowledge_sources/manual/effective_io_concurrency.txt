The knob 'effective_io_concurrency' sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations allowed in PostgreSQL sessions, with a range of 1 to 1000, or zero to disable asynchronous I/O. For magnetic drives, a good starting point is the number of drives in a RAID stripe, while SSDs may benefit from higher values.
