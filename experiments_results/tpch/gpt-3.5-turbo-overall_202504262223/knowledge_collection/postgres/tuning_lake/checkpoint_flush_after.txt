{'suggestion': "Consider adjusting the 'checkpoint_flush_after' knob to optimize the amount of data written during a checkpoint. This knob helps in controlling the dirty data in the kernel's page cache by specifying the threshold before forcing the OS to issue writes. The valid range for this adjustment is between 0 and 2MB, with a default value of 256kB on Linux."}
