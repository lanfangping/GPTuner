{'suggestion': "To optimize automatic checkpoints in the database system, consider raising the 'max_wal_size' parameter unless constrained by disk space. Increasing this value helps ensure that automatic checkpoints are primarily triggered by timeout rather than disk space limitations, albeit at the cost of longer recovery time post database crash. The 'max_wal_size' parameter, which establishes the soft limit for WAL growth during automatic checkpoints, defaults to 1 GB and can be specified in megabytes."}
