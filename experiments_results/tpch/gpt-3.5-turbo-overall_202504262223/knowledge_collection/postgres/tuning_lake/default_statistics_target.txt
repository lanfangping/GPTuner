{'suggestion': "Adjust the 'default_statistics_target' knob in PostgreSQL to set the default statistics target for table columns. Consider raising this value for large tables, understanding the impact on performance. Medium-sized systems usually benefit from values around 200, while larger systems may require values of 500 or 1000. This adjustment can help improve the planner's estimates, although it may lead to longer ANALYZE times."}
