{'suggestion': "Consider raising the 'autovacuum_max_workers' parameter to enhance the efficiency of autovacuum processes. This adjustment can help in smoothing I/O activity during checkpoints over extended periods. Note that the 'autovacuum_max_workers' parameter has a default value of three and can only be configured during server startup."}
