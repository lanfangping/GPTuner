{'suggestion': "For optimal performance in PostgreSQL, set the value for the 'shared_buffers' knob to allocate 25% of total available memory, up to a maximum of 2GB. This recommendation is based on the manual suggestion which provides detailed guidance on setting the 'shared_buffers' parameter. It is advised to allocate 25% of system memory for dedicated database servers with 1GB or more RAM, while for systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage should be used to leave space for the operating system. This approach aligns with the conventional wisdom of allocating 25% of RAM and ensures a balance between performance optimization and system resource allocation."}
