{'suggestion': "When setting the value for the 'min_wal_size' knob in postgres, consider calculating a minimum size based on the expected transaction rate and duration between base backups. It is recommended to reserve at least 80 MB of WAL space to handle spikes in usage, preventing premature removal of old WAL files. If disk space allows, raise the 'min_wal_size' to 1GB to ensure smoother operation."}
