{'suggestion': "To optimize Postgres performance, adjust the 'work_mem' parameter based on the memory usage in your queries. For OLTP queries with simple operations, set it to low MBs; for OLAP-style queries with few concurrent operations, increase it to GB range. Estimate the total memory potential by multiplying with max_connections * N. Avoid setting it too low to prevent disk usage impacting performance, but also avoid setting it too high to maintain node throughput stability. Consider raising the default value if feasible to enhance query operation efficiency."}
