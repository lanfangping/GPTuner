{'suggestion': "Adjust the 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' parameter at the server level or for specific tables to set the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples required to trigger a VACUUM process. The default value is 50 tuples. This adjustment can help optimize the performance of the database by managing VACUUM operations more efficiently."}
