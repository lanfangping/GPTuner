{'suggestion': 'Consider configuring the autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold parameter to control the initiation of VACUUM operations in tables. By setting this parameter, you can define the minimum number of inserted tuples required to trigger a VACUUM operation. The default value is 1000 tuples, but you can also set it to -1 to disable automatic VACUUM triggering based on inserts.'}
