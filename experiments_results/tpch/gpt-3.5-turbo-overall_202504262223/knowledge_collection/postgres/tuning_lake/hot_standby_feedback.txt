{'suggestion': "Set the 'hot_standby_feedback' knob to 'on' if you want to avoid read-only query cancellations running in the replicas. This setting allows hot standby to send feedback to the primary about executing queries, but keep in mind that it may cause increased bloat and WAL disk space consumption on the primary. The feedback messages should not be sent more frequently than once per wal_receiver_status_interval."}
