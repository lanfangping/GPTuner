{'suggestion': {'summary': "Adjust the 'track_activity_query_size' knob in PostgreSQL to limit the size of SQL query text tracked for each active session. Consider raising it to log up to 8KB of query text for query performance tracking. The default value for 'track_activity_query_size' is 1024 bytes, but you can set it to a specific number based on your requirements."}}
