{'suggestion': "Consider adjusting the 'checkpoint_timeout' parameter in PostgreSQL to optimize I/O usage and crash recovery time. Increasing the parameter may lead to larger I/O spikes and recovery time after a crash, but it can also improve I/O usage by creating more frequent checkpoints. The default value is set to five minutes (5min), and modifying this parameter can have a significant impact on the database performance."}
