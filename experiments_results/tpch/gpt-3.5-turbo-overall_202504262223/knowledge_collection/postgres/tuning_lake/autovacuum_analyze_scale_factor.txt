{'suggestion': {'description': "To optimize Postgres performance, adjust the 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' parameter to set the percentage of the table to be scanned during auto vacuum analyze. If disk space allows, increase this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are caused by timeout rather than disk space limitations, which can enhance recovery time after a database crash. Additionally, consider triggering an ANALYZE operation based on the table size fraction added to the autovacuum_analyze_threshold parameter."}}
