{'suggestion': "To optimize database performance, consider adjusting the 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' parameter to increase the percentage of table size added to the autovacuum_vacuum_threshold for triggering a VACUUM operation. The default value is very low, so unless there are significant disk space restrictions, raise it up to 1GB."}
