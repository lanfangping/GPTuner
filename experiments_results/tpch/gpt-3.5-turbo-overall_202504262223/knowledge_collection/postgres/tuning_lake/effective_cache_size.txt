{'suggestion': "Adjust the 'effective_cache_size' parameter in PostgreSQL to optimize index and sequential scan usage. Set it to: system RAM - (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) * 1.1, or a lower value if the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL. Note that this setting does not affect the amount of physical RAM used by queries."}
