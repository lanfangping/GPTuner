{'suggestion': "To optimize the performance of vacuum operations in Postgres, set the 'vacuum_cost_limit' knob to a value between 10 and 100 based on available memory and desired performance levels. Consider raising the parameter to reduce I/O spikes, but be mindful of potential impacts on checkpoint completion, bgwriter activity, and recovery time after a database crash. Keep in mind that the default value for 'vacuum_cost_limit' is 200, and adjusting it can improve I/O usage and overall vacuuming process efficiency."}
