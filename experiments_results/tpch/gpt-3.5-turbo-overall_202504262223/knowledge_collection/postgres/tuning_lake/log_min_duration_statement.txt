{'suggestion': "Set the 'log_min_duration_statement' parameter to a reasonable value, such as '1s', instead of '0', to log the duration of completed statements running for at least that time. This will help track down unoptimized queries. Utilize tools like pg_stat_statements or pg_stat_monitor to understand query performance better, especially if you have a low-traffic service."}
