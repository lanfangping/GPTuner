{'suggestion': {'summary': "To optimize the 'checkpoint_completion_target' value in Postgres, aim to set it between 0.5 to 0.9 for efficient checkpoint completion. This value should be adjusted based on the specific use case; for example, raise it to smooth I/O activity over larger periods but keep it low for non-streaming replicas. On development instances, consider setting it to '0.9'. The default target is 50% of the time between checkpoints, but adjusting within the recommended range can enhance performance.", 'source': 'manual_suggestion, web_suggestion, gpt_suggestion'}}
