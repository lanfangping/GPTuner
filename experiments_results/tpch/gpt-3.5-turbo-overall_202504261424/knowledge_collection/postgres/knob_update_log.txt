I first give you a knob of postgres, determine if it is related to resources, focusing primarily on CPU, RAM, disk size, and disk type. Note that some knobs may not appear directly related to resources but are indeed associated with them, so please exercise careful discernment. 

let's think step by step

step 1: Summarize the function of  knob from postgres  with no more than five sentences.
step 2: Judge whether this knob is related to cpu, ram, disk type or disk size.
step 3: If the knob is related to any hardware resource in step 2, return the boolean value true, otherwise, return the boolean value false.

Please give me the result in json format.
