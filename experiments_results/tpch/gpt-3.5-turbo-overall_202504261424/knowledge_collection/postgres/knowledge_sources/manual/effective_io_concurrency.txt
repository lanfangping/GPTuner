The 'effective_io_concurrency' knob sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that PostgreSQL expects can be executed simultaneously, with a range of 1 to 1000 or zero to disable asynchronous I/O requests, and is recommended to be set based on the number of separate drives comprising a RAID 0 stripe or RAID 1 mirror for magnetic drives, while SSDs and memory-based storage devices can often handle hundreds of concurrent requests effectively.
