The 'constraint_exclusion' knob controls the query planner's optimization of queries by examining table constraints, with options including on (all tables), off (never inspect constraints), and partition (only child tables and UNION ALL subqueries), with partition as the default setting often used to improve performance, but turning it on for all tables may not benefit simple queries.
