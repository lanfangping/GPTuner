{'suggestion': "When configuring the 'shared_buffers' parameter for your Postgres database server, consider setting it based on your specific workload and system resources. Start with the default value of 128MB and gradually increase it up to 25% of the system memory for dedicated servers with 1GB or more RAM. Conduct performance benchmarks to fine-tune this parameter. For large databases in the hundreds of GBs, also evaluate the use of huge pages. Additionally, adjust memory allocations for each Postgres instance on non-dedicated servers to optimize resource utilization."}
