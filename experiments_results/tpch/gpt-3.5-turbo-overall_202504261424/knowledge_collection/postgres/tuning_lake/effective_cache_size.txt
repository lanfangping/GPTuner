{'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance, set the 'effective_cache_size' parameter to a value calculated as system RAM minus the sum of (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) multiplied by 1.1, ensuring a lower value if the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL. This setting influences the planner's assumption of disk cache availability, affecting the likelihood of index scans versus sequential scans based on expected concurrent queries and shared buffers. Note that this setting does not impact the physical RAM used by queries."}
