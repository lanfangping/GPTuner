{'suggestion': "Adjust the 'default_statistics_target' knob in PostgreSQL using the ALTER DATABASE or ALTER ROLE command to set it between 1 and 1000. Consider raising this value for large tables, understanding the impact on performance. For medium-sized systems, values around 200 are suitable, while larger systems may benefit from values up to 500 or 1000. Increasing this setting can enhance planner estimates, although it may result in longer ANALYZE times."}
