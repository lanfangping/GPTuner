{'suggestion': "To optimize the performance of your PostgreSQL database replication setup, consider adjusting the 'hot_standby_feedback' knob value to be equal to or lower than the estimated recovery time of the standby server to receive feedback from the primary server. This will help in reducing query cancellations on read-only replicas. Keep in mind that setting 'hot_standby_feedback' to 'on' can improve query stability by reducing cancels but may lead to potential database bloat. Ensure that feedback messages are sent at intervals defined by 'wal_receiver_status_interval' to strike a balance between query stability and database performance."}
