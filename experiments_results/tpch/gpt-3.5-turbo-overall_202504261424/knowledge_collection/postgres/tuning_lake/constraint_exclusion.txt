{'suggestion': "Consider utilizing the 'constraint_exclusion' knob in your query planner to optimize queries by examining table constraints. This knob offers options such as 'on' for all tables, 'off' to never inspect constraints, and 'partition' for only child tables and UNION ALL subqueries. The default setting is 'partition,' commonly used to enhance performance. Evaluate the potential benefits for your specific queries before enabling this setting for all tables."}
