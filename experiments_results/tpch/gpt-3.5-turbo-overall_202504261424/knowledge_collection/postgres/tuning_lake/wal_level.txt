{'suggestion': "Consider adjusting the 'wal_level' parameter to control the amount of information written to the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) in your database system. This parameter offers options such as replica, minimal, and logical, with each level serving different purposes like archiving, replication, or logical decoding. Evaluate your specific requirements to determine the most suitable 'wal_level' setting for optimal performance and data management."}
