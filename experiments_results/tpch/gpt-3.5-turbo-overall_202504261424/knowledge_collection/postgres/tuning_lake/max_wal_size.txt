{'suggestion': "To optimize database performance and recovery time, consider adjusting the 'max_wal_size' parameter in the postgresql.conf file or server command line. Unless disk space constraints are a concern, raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are primarily caused by timeout rather than disk space. Increasing 'max_wal_size' allows for a larger WAL growth during automatic checkpoints, potentially increasing crash recovery time."}
