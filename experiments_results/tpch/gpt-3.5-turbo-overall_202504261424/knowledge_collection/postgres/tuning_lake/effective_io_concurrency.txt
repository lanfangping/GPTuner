{'suggestion': "Set the 'effective_io_concurrency' knob in PostgreSQL to control the number of concurrent disk I/O operations. The recommended setting depends on the number of separate drives in RAID configurations. For magnetic drives, consider the number of drives in RAID 0 or RAID 1. SSDs and memory-based storage devices can handle hundreds of concurrent requests effectively. The range for this knob is 1 to 1000, or zero to disable asynchronous I/O requests."}
