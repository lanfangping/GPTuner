{'suggestion': "To optimize performance in PostgreSQL, consider using connection pooling for most use cases. When using connection pooling in transaction mode, set the parameter as a low multiple (2-5x) of the number of cores on the server. If connection pooling is not used, set the 'max_connections' parameter to the required number of concurrent users. The 'max_connections' parameter determines the maximum number of concurrent connections to the database server and should be set at server start with the same or higher value on standby servers to allow queries. Performance may be suboptimal if the 'max_connections' parameter is not appropriately configured."}
