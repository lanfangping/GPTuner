{'suggestion': "To enhance write performance on busy servers, consider adjusting the 'wal_buffers' parameter, which determines the shared memory allocated for WAL data that has not been written to disk. By manually setting this parameter, you can optimize write performance beyond the default setting of 1/32nd of shared_buffers."}
