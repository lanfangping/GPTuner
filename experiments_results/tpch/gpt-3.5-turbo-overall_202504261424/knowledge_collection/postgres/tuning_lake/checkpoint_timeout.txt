{'suggestion': {'summary': "Adjust the 'checkpoint_timeout' knob in Postgres to set the desired time interval in seconds for triggering checkpoints. Increasing the value may lead to larger I/O spikes and longer recovery time after a crash. However, raising it typically improves I/O usage by creating more frequent checkpoints. The knob specifies the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints, defaulting to five minutes, and increasing it can extend the time needed for crash recovery."}}
