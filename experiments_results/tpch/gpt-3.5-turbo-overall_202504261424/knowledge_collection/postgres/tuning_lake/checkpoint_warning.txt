{'suggestion': "To optimize database performance, monitor checkpoint frequency in the logs. If checkpoints occur within 30 seconds of each other, consider increasing max_wal_size. Set the checkpoint alert threshold to a fraction of checkpoint_timeout (e.g. '5min') or '1min' if checkpoint_timeout is not optimized."}
