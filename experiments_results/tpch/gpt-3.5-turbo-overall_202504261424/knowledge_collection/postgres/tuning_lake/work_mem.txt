{'suggestion': "To optimize query performance, adjust the 'work_mem' parameter based on the memory usage in your queries. For OLTP queries without complex joins, a low MB value may suffice; whereas, OLAP-style queries with few concurrent operations may require a value in the GB range. It is essential to find a balance to prevent performance impact from using memory and disk excessively while ensuring node throughput stability. Consider raising the default value to accommodate concurrent sort and hash operations effectively."}
