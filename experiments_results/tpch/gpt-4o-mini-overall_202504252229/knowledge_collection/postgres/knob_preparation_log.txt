                Summerize the description for knob 'work_mem' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the base maximum amount of memory to be used by a query operation (such as a sort or hash table) before writing to temporary disk files. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as kilobytes. The default value is four megabytes (4MB). Note that a complex query might perform several sort and hash operations at the same time, with each operation generally being allowed to use as much memory as this value specifies before it starts to write data into temporary files. Also, several running sessions could be doing such operations concurrently. Therefore, the total memory used could be many times the value of work_mem; it is necessary to keep this fact in mind when choosing the value. Sort operations are used for ORDER BY, DISTINCT, and merge joins. Hash tables are used in hash joins, hash-based aggregation, and hash-based processing of IN subqueries.
Hash-based operations are generally more sensitive to memory availability than equivalent sort-based operations. The memory limit for a hash table is computed by multiplying work_mem by hash_mem_multiplier. This makes it possible for hash-based operations to use an amount of memory that exceeds the usual work_mem base amount.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:
 {'boot_val': '4096', 'category': 'Resource Usage / Memory', 'context': 'user', 'enumvals': None, 'extra_desc': 'This much memory can be used by each internal sort operation and hash table before switching to temporary disk files.', 'max_val': '2147483647', 'min_val': '64', 'name': 'work_mem', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': '4096', 'setting': '4096', 'short_desc': 'Sets the maximum memory to be used for query workspaces.', 'source': 'configuration file', 'sourcefile': '/var/lib/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.auto.conf', 'sourceline': 19, 'unit': 'kB', 'vartype': 'integer'}
 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the `work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL, start by allocating approximately 1-2 MB per concurrent query for basic workloads, but for analytical queries or larger operations, consider increasing it to 16-64 MB or more, ensuring that the total memory used by all concurrent sessions does not exceed your system's available memory.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Setting this parameter requires inspecting the memory usage in your queries. If this value falls short in a query execution, the engine will use memory and disk, impacting on its performance. Although, keeping this value too large, could destabilize the node throughput when dealing with too many concurrent operations. For OLTP queries that do not require complex joins or sorting lots of data, this value may be in the low MBs. For OLAP-style queries, and few concurrent queries, it may grow into the GB range. Multiply by max_connections * N (being N a small single-digit number) to estimate the maximum amount of total memory potential consumed by Postgres process. Adjust based on it. If possible, raise the default value.The default value for work_mem is 4MB. This is generally acknowledged to be too small for most modern systems. For example, Christophe Pettus suggests that 16MB is a good starting point for most people. So it’s pretty normal to at least consider increasing it. work_mem = <1-5% of RAM>

 Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format.:

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

                Summerize the description for knob 'effective_io_concurrency' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that PostgreSQL expects can be executed simultaneously. Raising this value will increase the number of I/O operations that any individual PostgreSQL session attempts to initiate in parallel. The allowed range is 1 to 1000, or zero to disable issuance of asynchronous I/O requests. Currently, this setting only affects bitmap heap scans.
For magnetic drives, a good starting point for this setting is the number of separate drives comprising a RAID 0 stripe or RAID 1 mirror being used for the database. (For RAID 5 the parity drive should not be counted.) However, if the database is often busy with multiple queries issued in concurrent sessions, lower values may be sufficient to keep the disk array busy. A value higher than needed to keep the disks busy will only result in extra CPU overhead. SSDs and other memory-based storage can often process many concurrent requests, so the best value might be in the hundreds.
Asynchronous I/O depends on an effective posix_fadvise function, which some operating systems lack. If the function is not present then setting this parameter to anything but zero will result in an error. On some operating systems (e.g., Solaris), the function is present but does not actually do anything.
The default is 1 on supported systems, otherwise 0. This value can be overridden for tables in a particular tablespace by setting the tablespace parameter of the same name (see ALTER TABLESPACE).

                DESCRIPTION:
                Allows the use of parallel queries for testing purposes even in cases where no performance benefit is expected. The allowed values of force_parallel_mode are off (use parallel mode only when it is expected to improve performance), on (force parallel query for all queries for which it is thought to be safe), and regress (like on, but with additional behavior changes as explained below).
More specifically, setting this value to on will add a Gather node to the top of any query plan for which this appears to be safe, so that the query runs inside of a parallel worker. Even when a parallel worker is not available or cannot be used, operations such as starting a subtransaction that would be prohibited in a parallel query context will be prohibited unless the planner believes that this will cause the query to fail. If failures or unexpected results occur when this option is set, some functions used by the query may need to be marked PARALLEL UNSAFE (or, possibly, PARALLEL RESTRICTED).
Setting this value to regress has all of the same effects as setting it to on plus some additional effects that are intended to facilitate automated regression testing. Normally, messages from a parallel worker include a context line indicating that, but a setting of regress suppresses this line so that the output is the same as in non-parallel execution. Also, the Gather nodes added to plans by this setting are hidden in EXPLAIN output so that the output matches what would be obtained if this setting were turned off.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.

                Summerize the description for knob 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the maximum number of workers that can be started by a single Gather or Gather Merge node. Parallel workers are taken from the pool of processes established by max_worker_processes, limited by max_parallel_workers. Note that the requested number of workers may not actually be available at run time. If this occurs, the plan will run with fewer workers than expected, which may be inefficient. The default value is 2. Setting this value to 0 disables parallel query execution.
Note that parallel queries may consume very substantially more resources than non-parallel queries, because each worker process is a completely separate process which has roughly the same impact on the system as an additional user session. This should be taken into account when choosing a value for this setting, as well as when configuring other settings that control resource utilization, such as work_mem. Resource limits such as work_mem are applied individually to each worker, which means the total utilization may be much higher across all processes than it would normally be for any single process. For example, a parallel query using 4 workers may use up to 5 times as much CPU time, memory, I/O bandwidth, and so forth as a query which uses no workers at all.
For more information on parallel query, see Chapter 15.

Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter in PostgreSQL, a good rule of thumb is to initially configure it to a value between 2 and 4, depending on your workload and available system resources, while ensuring that the total number of parallel workers does not exceed `max_worker_processes`, which typically defaults to 8; therefore, starting with 4 may provide a balanced approach for many use cases.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Beware of setting to a high value for high throughput OLTP systems. Oftentimes it is better to leave it on 1 or 2 at most. Raise it for analytical/DW systems, always to a fraction of cores. This parameter is affected by work_mem, we recommend to review that value accordingly.

Suggestions:{'gpt_suggestion': 'To set the `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter in PostgreSQL, a good rule of thumb is to initially configure it to a value between 2 and 4, depending on your workload and available system resources, while ensuring that the total number of parallel workers does not exceed `max_worker_processes`, which typically defaults to 8; therefore, starting with 4 may provide a balanced approach for many use cases.', 'web_suggestion': 'Beware of setting to a high value for high throughput OLTP systems. Oftentimes it is better to leave it on 1 or 2 at most. Raise it for analytical/DW systems, always to a fraction of cores. This parameter is affected by work_mem, we recommend to review that value accordingly.', 'manual_suggestion': "The 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' setting controls the maximum number of workers that can be utilized by a single Gather or Gather Merge node; it's important to note that actual worker availability may vary at runtime, and using more workers significantly increases resource consumption, potentially up to 5 times more than a non-parallel query."}
Summary:{'suggestion': 'To configure the `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter in PostgreSQL, start with a value between 1 and 4, depending on your workload type and available system resources. For high throughput OLTP systems, it is advisable to keep this setting at 1 or 2 to avoid excessive resource consumption, while for analytical or data warehousing systems, it can be raised, but should remain a fraction of the total cores available. Additionally, ensure that the total number of parallel workers does not exceed `max_worker_processes`, which typically defaults to 8, and consider the impact of `work_mem` on this setting.'}

Summerize the description for knob 'track_io_timing' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Enables timing of database I/O calls. This parameter is off by default, because it will repeatedly query the operating system for the current time, which may cause significant overhead on some platforms. You can use the pg_test_timing tool to measure the overhead of timing on your system. I/O timing information is displayed in pg_stat_database, in the output of EXPLAIN when the BUFFERS option is used, and by pg_stat_statements. Only superusers can change this setting.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

DESCRIPTION:
Specifies a fraction of the table size to add to autovacuum_vacuum_threshold when deciding whether to trigger a VACUUM. The default is 0.2 (20% of table size). This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

OFFICIAL_DOC:

                Summerize the description for knob 'fsync' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                If this parameter is on, the PostgreSQL server will try to make sure that updates are physically written to disk, by issuing fsync() system calls or various equivalent methods (see wal_sync_method). This ensures that the database cluster can recover to a consistent state after an operating system or hardware crash.
While turning off fsync is often a performance benefit, this can result in unrecoverable data corruption in the event of a power failure or system crash. Thus it is only advisable to turn off fsync if you can easily recreate your entire database from external data.
Examples of safe circumstances for turning off fsync include the initial loading of a new database cluster from a backup file, using a database cluster for processing a batch of data after which the database will be thrown away and recreated, or for a read-only database clone which gets recreated frequently and is not used for failover. High quality hardware alone is not a sufficient justification for turning off fsync.
For reliable recovery when changing fsync off to on, it is necessary to force all modified buffers in the kernel to durable storage. This can be done while the cluster is shutdown or while fsync is on by running initdb --sync-only, running sync, unmounting the file system, or rebooting the server.
In many situations, turning off synchronous_commit for noncritical transactions can provide much of the potential performance benefit of turning off fsync, without the attendant risks of data corruption.
fsync can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. If you turn this parameter off, also consider turning off full_page_writes.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies the maximum age (in multixacts) that a table's pg_class.relminmxid field can attain before a VACUUM operation is forced to prevent multixact ID wraparound within the table. Note that the system will launch autovacuum processes to prevent wraparound even when autovacuum is otherwise disabled.
Vacuuming multixacts also allows removal of old files from the pg_multixact/members and pg_multixact/offsets subdirectories, which is why the default is a relatively low 400 million multixacts. This parameter can only be set at server start, but the setting can be reduced for individual tables by changing table storage parameters. For more information see Section 24.1.5.1.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

Summerize the description for knob 'jit_optimize_above_cost' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Sets the query cost above which JIT compilation applies expensive optimizations. Such optimization adds planning time, but can improve execution speed. It is not meaningful to set this to less than jit_above_cost, and it is unlikely to be beneficial to set it to more than jit_inline_above_cost. Setting this to -1 disables expensive optimizations. The default is 500000.

Summerize the description for knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Specifies the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples needed to trigger a VACUUM in any one table. The default is 50 tuples. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the maximum amount of memory used for temporary buffers within each database session. These are session-local buffers used only for access to temporary tables. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. The default is eight megabytes (8MB). (If BLCKSZ is not 8kB, the default value scales proportionally to it.) This setting can be changed within individual sessions, but only before the first use of temporary tables within the session; subsequent attempts to change the value will have no effect on that session.
A session will allocate temporary buffers as needed up to the limit given by temp_buffers. The cost of setting a large value in sessions that do not actually need many temporary buffers is only a buffer descriptor, or about 64 bytes, per increment in temp_buffers. However if a buffer is actually used an additional 8192 bytes will be consumed for it (or in general, BLCKSZ bytes).

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

                Summerize the description for knob 'synchronous_commit' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies how much WAL processing must complete before the database server returns a “success” indication to the client. Valid values are remote_apply, on (the default), remote_write, local, and off.
If synchronous_standby_names is empty, the only meaningful settings are on and off; remote_apply, remote_write and local all provide the same local synchronization level as on. The local behavior of all non-off modes is to wait for local flush of WAL to disk. In off mode, there is no waiting, so there can be a delay between when success is reported to the client and when the transaction is later guaranteed to be safe against a server crash. (The maximum delay is three times wal_writer_delay.) Unlike fsync, setting this parameter to off does not create any risk of database inconsistency: an operating system or database crash might result in some recent allegedly-committed transactions being lost, but the database state will be just the same as if those transactions had been aborted cleanly. So, turning synchronous_commit off can be a useful alternative when performance is more important than exact certainty about the durability of a transaction. For more discussion see Section 29.3.
If synchronous_standby_names is non-empty, synchronous_commit also controls whether transaction commits will wait for their WAL records to be processed on the standby server(s).
When set to remote_apply, commits will wait until replies from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received the commit record of the transaction and applied it, so that it has become visible to queries on the standby(s), and also written to durable storage on the standbys. This will cause much larger commit delays than previous settings since it waits for WAL replay. When set to on, commits wait until replies from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received the commit record of the transaction and flushed it to durable storage. This ensures the transaction will not be lost unless both the primary and all synchronous standbys suffer corruption of their database storage. When set to remote_write, commits will wait until replies from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received the commit record of the transaction and written it to their file systems. This setting ensures data preservation if a standby instance of PostgreSQL crashes, but not if the standby suffers an operating-system-level crash because the data has not necessarily reached durable storage on the standby. The setting local causes commits to wait for local flush to disk, but not for replication. This is usually not desirable when synchronous replication is in use, but is provided for completeness.
This parameter can be changed at any time; the behavior for any one transaction is determined by the setting in effect when it commits. It is therefore possible, and useful, to have some transactions commit synchronously and others asynchronously. For example, to make a single multistatement transaction commit asynchronously when the default is the opposite, issue SET LOCAL synchronous_commit TO OFF within the transaction.
Table 19.1 summarizes the capabilities of the synchronous_commit settings.

If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.

 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the `enable_indexscan` knob in PostgreSQL, you can adjust its value to `on` (default) to allow index scans or `off` to disable them, with the command `SET enable_indexscan = on;` or `SET enable_indexscan = off;`, but ensure that any necessary performance testing is conducted, as disabling index scans can significantly impact query performance depending on your specific workload and dataset.

DESCRIPTION:
Enables or disables the query planner's ability to eliminate a partitioned table's partitions from query plans. This also controls the planner's ability to generate query plans which allow the query executor to remove (ignore) partitions during query execution. The default is on. See Section 5.11.4 for details.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

Summerize the description for knob 'enable_partitionwise_aggregate' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Enables or disables the query planner's use of partitionwise grouping or aggregation, which allows grouping or aggregation on partitioned tables to be performed separately for each partition. If the GROUP BY clause does not include the partition keys, only partial aggregation can be performed on a per-partition basis, and finalization must be performed later. With this setting enabled, the number of nodes whose memory usage is restricted by work_mem appearing in the final plan can increase linearly according to the number of partitions being scanned. This can result in a large increase in overall memory consumption during the execution of the query. Query planning also becomes significantly more expensive in terms of memory and CPU. The default value is off.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

DESCRIPTION:
Specifies a fraction of the table size to add to autovacuum_analyze_threshold when deciding whether to trigger an ANALYZE. The default is 0.1 (10% of table size). This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` in PostgreSQL, a recommended value is between 0.1 and 0.2, meaning that autovacuum will trigger an ANALYZE when 10% to 20% of the table has changed, with the default being 0.1 (10%), which can be adjusted based on the workload and frequency of data modifications in your specific use case.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Unless there are disk space constraints, raise this value to make sure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. Increasing this value increases the recovery time after a database crash.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion.

 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Raise it to smooth I/O activity of checkpoints over larger periods of time. If you rely on this value for feeding non-streaming replicas, it is recommended to keep this within a low percentage. On development instances, it is usual to set it to ‘0.9’.

Summerize the description for knob 'effective_cache_size' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Sets the planner's assumption about the effective size of the disk cache that is available to a single query. This is factored into estimates of the cost of using an index; a higher value makes it more likely index scans will be used, a lower value makes it more likely sequential scans will be used. When setting this parameter you should consider both PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the portion of the kernel's disk cache that will be used for PostgreSQL data files, though some data might exist in both places. Also, take into account the expected number of concurrent queries on different tables, since they will have to share the available space. This parameter has no effect on the size of shared memory allocated by PostgreSQL, nor does it reserve kernel disk cache; it is used only for estimation purposes. The system also does not assume data remains in the disk cache between queries. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. The default is 4 gigabytes (4GB). (If BLCKSZ is not 8kB, the default value scales proportionally to it.)

If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the `effective_cache_size` in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to use a value that represents approximately 50-75% of the total system memory available for database operations; for example, if your system has 16 GB of RAM, you can set `effective_cache_size` to around 8-12 GB (8192-12288 MB).
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Set it to (approximately): system RAM - (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) * 1.1, or a lower value if the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL. Note that this setting does not affect the amount of physical RAM used by queries.

Do not remove the other information. The priority is defined in sequence as "manual_suggestion, web_suggestion, gpt_suggestion" from higher to lower. So manual_suggestion should not be changed. If there is contradiction within the same suggestion, keep it.  Try to make your summary encapsulates information from the three suggestions as much as possible except from the contradictory parts.    
THREE SUGGESTIONS:
{'gpt_suggestion': 'To optimize the `enable_sort` setting in PostgreSQL, normally you should set it to `on` (the default) to allow sorting operations, which can be beneficial for queries that require sorted results, but you may consider setting it to `off` for queries where sorting is not necessary and performance is critical, though this requires assessing specific use cases and performance impacts.', 'web_suggestion': None, 'manual_suggestion': "The 'enable_sort' knob, which defaults to on, allows the query planner to use explicit sort steps, with the option to disable it in order to discourage sorting when alternative methods are available."}

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

                Summerize the description for knob 'maintenance_work_mem' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies the maximum amount of memory to be used by maintenance operations, such as VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as kilobytes. It defaults to 64 megabytes (64MB). Since only one of these operations can be executed at a time by a database session, and an installation normally doesn't have many of them running concurrently, it's safe to set this value significantly larger than work_mem. Larger settings might improve performance for vacuuming and for restoring database dumps.
Note that when autovacuum runs, up to autovacuum_max_workers times this memory may be allocated, so be careful not to set the default value too high. It may be useful to control for this by separately setting autovacuum_work_mem.
Note that for the collection of dead tuple identifiers, VACUUM is only able to utilize up to a maximum of 1GB of memory.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:
 {'boot_val': '65536', 'category': 'Resource Usage / Memory', 'context': 'user', 'enumvals': None, 'extra_desc': 'This includes operations such as VACUUM and CREATE INDEX.', 'max_val': '2147483647', 'min_val': '1024', 'name': 'maintenance_work_mem', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': '65536', 'setting': '65536', 'short_desc': 'Sets the maximum memory to be used for maintenance operations.', 'source': 'configuration file', 'sourcefile': '/var/lib/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.auto.conf', 'sourceline': 13, 'unit': 'kB', 'vartype': 'integer'}
 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the `maintenance_work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL, allocate between 10% to 20% of the available system memory for maintenance tasks, typically using a starting value of around 64MB for small systems and up to 1GB or more for larger systems, while ensuring it does not exceed the available RAM to avoid memory pressure.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Increasing this value will speed up maintenance tasks such as VACUUM and index rebuilds, therefore it is recommended to raise it notably with large RAM resources and write operations. Note that this is -unless directly controlled by autovacuum_work_mem- also the amount of memory *each* autovacuum workers might use.

                DESCRIPTION:
                When this parameter is on, the PostgreSQL server compresses a full page image written to WAL when full_page_writes is on or during a base backup. A compressed page image will be decompressed during WAL replay. The default value is off. Only superusers can change this setting.
Turning this parameter on can reduce the WAL volume without increasing the risk of unrecoverable data corruption, but at the cost of some extra CPU spent on the compression during WAL logging and on the decompression during WAL replay.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 The `wal_compression` setting in PostgreSQL should be enabled (set to `on`) if you have a high write workload and your writes exceed 1 GB per hour, as it can reduce the size of WAL files and improve disk I/O, particularly when combined with a high `max_wal_size` (e.g., 1 GB or more), but it should be tested for your specific workload to ensure it doesn't negatively impact performance.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 None

Summerize the description for knob 'max_wal_size' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Maximum size to let the WAL grow during automatic checkpoints. This is a soft limit; WAL size can exceed max_wal_size under special circumstances, such as heavy load, a failing archive_command, or a high wal_keep_size setting. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as megabytes. The default is 1 GB. Increasing this parameter can increase the amount of time needed for crash recovery. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the `max_wal_size` parameter in PostgreSQL, one should aim for a value between 1 GB and 4 GB, depending on the workload; for instance, a commonly recommended starting point is 2 GB, which can be adjusted upwards as performance demands increase and based on the available disk space.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Unless there are disk space constraints, raise this value to make sure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. Increasing this value increases the recovery time after a database crash.

Summerize the description for knob 'enable_partitionwise_join' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Enables or disables the query planner's use of partitionwise join, which allows a join between partitioned tables to be performed by joining the matching partitions. Partitionwise join currently applies only when the join conditions include all the partition keys, which must be of the same data type and have one-to-one matching sets of child partitions. With this setting enabled, the number of nodes whose memory usage is restricted by work_mem appearing in the final plan can increase linearly according to the number of partitions being scanned. This can result in a large increase in overall memory consumption during the execution of the query. Query planning also becomes significantly more expensive in terms of memory and CPU. The default value is off.

If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value.

                Summerize the description for knob 'shared_buffers' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers. The default is typically 128 megabytes (128MB), but might be less if your kernel settings will not support it (as determined during initdb). This setting must be at least 128 kilobytes. However, settings significantly higher than the minimum are usually needed for good performance. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. (Non-default values of BLCKSZ change the minimum value.) This parameter can only be set at server start.
If you have a dedicated database server with 1GB or more of RAM, a reasonable starting value for shared_buffers is 25% of the memory in your system. There are some workloads where even larger settings for shared_buffers are effective, but because PostgreSQL also relies on the operating system cache, it is unlikely that an allocation of more than 40% of RAM to shared_buffers will work better than a smaller amount. Larger settings for shared_buffers usually require a corresponding increase in max_wal_size, in order to spread out the process of writing large quantities of new or changed data over a longer period of time.
On systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage of RAM is appropriate, so as to leave adequate space for the operating system.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the `shared_buffers` parameter in PostgreSQL, configure it to about 25% of the total system RAM, typically ranging from 128MB to 8GB for most workloads, while ensuring it does not exceed the system's maximum available memory for PostgreSQL processes.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Conventional wisdom suggests 25% of the RAM. Do your own benchmarks varying this parameter. If you are into hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. Adjust accordingly for non-dedicated servers, considering that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations. This variable is in direct relation with OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`.

                DESCRIPTION:
                wal_level determines how much information is written to the WAL. The default value is replica, which writes enough data to support WAL archiving and replication, including running read-only queries on a standby server. minimal removes all logging except the information required to recover from a crash or immediate shutdown. Finally, logical adds information necessary to support logical decoding. Each level includes the information logged at all lower levels. This parameter can only be set at server start.
The minimal level generates the least WAL volume. It logs no row information for permanent relations in transactions that create or rewrite them. This can make operations much faster (see Section 14.4.7). Operations that initiate this optimization include:
But minimal WAL does not contain enough information to reconstruct the data from a base backup and the WAL logs, so replica or higher must be used to enable WAL archiving (archive_mode) and streaming replication.
In logical level, the same information is logged as with replica, plus information needed to allow extracting logical change sets from the WAL. Using a level of logical will increase the WAL volume, particularly if many tables are configured for REPLICA IDENTITY FULL and many UPDATE and DELETE statements are executed.
In releases prior to 9.6, this parameter also allowed the values archive and hot_standby. These are still accepted but mapped to replica.

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
Step 4: Return your three suggestions in the same json format.

DESCRIPTION:
Maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as seconds. The valid range is between 30 seconds and one day. The default is five minutes (5min). Increasing this parameter can increase the amount of time needed for crash recovery. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To optimize the 'checkpoint_timeout' parameter in PostgreSQL, set its value to between 5 and 15 minutes (300 to 900 seconds), depending on your workload and performance needs, with a starting recommendation of 10 minutes (600 seconds) for typical use cases to balance transaction safety and write performance.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Normally you want to raise it (e.g. ‘15min’). The larger the parameter is, you may experience larger I/O spikes (which may be smoothed out tuning checkpoint_completion_target and bgwriter activity) and the larger recovery time you may experience after a database crash. However, more frequent checkpoints create in aggregation more I/O, so raising it typically improves I/O usage.

 Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format.:

     "gpt_suggestion": null ,   // if there is a contradiction, remove the contradictory part, else return the corresponding original suggestion.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Sets the planner's estimate of the cost of a non-sequentially-fetched disk page. The default is 4.0. This value can be overridden for tables and indexes in a particular tablespace by setting the tablespace parameter of the same name (see ALTER TABLESPACE).
Reducing this value relative to seq_page_cost will cause the system to prefer index scans; raising it will make index scans look relatively more expensive. You can raise or lower both values together to change the importance of disk I/O costs relative to CPU costs, which are described by the following parameters.
Random access to mechanical disk storage is normally much more expensive than four times sequential access. However, a lower default is used (4.0) because the majority of random accesses to disk, such as indexed reads, are assumed to be in cache. The default value can be thought of as modeling random access as 40 times slower than sequential, while expecting 90% of random reads to be cached.
If you believe a 90% cache rate is an incorrect assumption for your workload, you can increase random_page_cost to better reflect the true cost of random storage reads. Correspondingly, if your data is likely to be completely in cache, such as when the database is smaller than the total server memory, decreasing random_page_cost can be appropriate. Storage that has a low random read cost relative to sequential, e.g., solid-state drives, might also be better modeled with a lower value for random_page_cost, e.g., 1.1.
Although the system will let you set random_page_cost to less than seq_page_cost, it is not physically sensible to do so. However, setting them equal makes sense if the database is entirely cached in RAM, since in that case there is no penalty for touching pages out of sequence. Also, in a heavily-cached database you should lower both values relative to the CPU parameters, since the cost of fetching a page already in RAM is much smaller than it would normally be.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 The `random_page_cost` parameter in PostgreSQL should typically be set to a value between 1.1 and 4.0, with a common starting point of 4.0 for traditional spinning disks, and adjusted lower (e.g., 1.1 to 2.0) for systems with solid-state drives (SSDs) to reflect faster random I/O performance.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Set it to 1.x (e.g. ‘1.2’) if your disk technology has a random access profile similar to that of SSDs.

 Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format.:

                Summerize the description for knob 'full_page_writes' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
                DESCRIPTION:
                When this parameter is on, the PostgreSQL server writes the entire content of each disk page to WAL during the first modification of that page after a checkpoint. This is needed because a page write that is in process during an operating system crash might be only partially completed, leading to an on-disk page that contains a mix of old and new data. The row-level change data normally stored in WAL will not be enough to completely restore such a page during post-crash recovery. Storing the full page image guarantees that the page can be correctly restored, but at the price of increasing the amount of data that must be written to WAL. (Because WAL replay always starts from a checkpoint, it is sufficient to do this during the first change of each page after a checkpoint. Therefore, one way to reduce the cost of full-page writes is to increase the checkpoint interval parameters.)
Turning this parameter off speeds normal operation, but might lead to either unrecoverable data corruption, or silent data corruption, after a system failure. The risks are similar to turning off fsync, though smaller, and it should be turned off only based on the same circumstances recommended for that parameter.
Turning off this parameter does not affect use of WAL archiving for point-in-time recovery (PITR) (see Section 25.3).
This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. The default is on.

DESCRIPTION:
Specifies the maximum number of autovacuum processes (other than the autovacuum launcher) that may be running at any one time. The default is three. This parameter can only be set at server start.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 The value for the `autovacuum_max_workers` knob in PostgreSQL should typically be set to 3 or 4 for most systems, but it can be increased to up to 10 if your server has adequate resources, allowing for more concurrent autovacuum processes to run and thus improving database maintenance efficiency.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 Raise it to smooth I/O activity of checkpoints over larger periods of time. If you rely on this value for feeding non-streaming replicas, it is recommended to keep this within a low percentage. On development instances, it is usual to set it to ‘0.9’.

                DESCRIPTION:
                Specifies the maximum age (in transactions) that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can attain before a VACUUM operation is forced to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. Note that the system will launch autovacuum processes to prevent wraparound even when autovacuum is otherwise disabled.
Vacuum also allows removal of old files from the pg_xact subdirectory, which is why the default is a relatively low 200 million transactions. This parameter can only be set at server start, but the setting can be reduced for individual tables by changing table storage parameters. For more information see Section 24.1.5.

Summerize the description for knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' in a sentence. This sentence should be associated with concrete numbers as more detailed information if needed.
DESCRIPTION:
Specifies the cost limit value that will be used in automatic VACUUM operations. If -1 is specified (which is the default), the regular vacuum_cost_limit value will be used. Note that the value is distributed proportionally among the running autovacuum workers, if there is more than one, so that the sum of the limits for each worker does not exceed the value of this variable. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters.

I first give you information of a knob of postgres which is extracted from the official document in json format, this offers the constraints of the value of each knob. Then I offer you two suggestions for this knob from GPT and WEB, judge whether each suggestion satisfies the constraints of the offcial document. If there is a contradiction between certain suggestion and the official document, remove the contradictory part. If there is not a contradiction, return the original suggestion.  

 Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value and max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val", "reset_val".
 Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is illegal according to the OFFICIAL_DOC, unit conversion may be required in the process. If so, remove the illegal values and the relevant information, rewrite the corresponding suggestion. 
 Step 3: Return your answer in json format.

 OFFICIAL_DOC:
 {'boot_val': '-1', 'category': 'Autovacuum', 'context': 'sighup', 'enumvals': None, 'extra_desc': None, 'max_val': '10000', 'min_val': '-1', 'name': 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit', 'pending_restart': False, 'reset_val': '-1', 'setting': '-1', 'short_desc': 'Vacuum cost amount available before napping, for autovacuum.', 'source': 'configuration file', 'sourcefile': '/var/lib/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.auto.conf', 'sourceline': 7, 'unit': None, 'vartype': 'integer'}
 GPT_SUGGESTION:
 To set the `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` value in PostgreSQL, you should generally start with a baseline of 2000 and adjust it based on system performance, workload, and available resources, increasing it incrementally (e.g., by 500 or 1000) if you observe frequent vacuuming or if you can afford higher resource usage during maintenance operations without impacting overall performance.
 WEB_SUGGESTION:
 None

 Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format.:

I offer you three suggestions for tuning a knob of postgres derived from GPT, web and manual. Your job is to identify whether each suggestion contains information which state the legal range of the knob witch is the same as the OFFICIAL_DOC and remove it. If you find this kind of information, rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include this information about "min_val" and "max_val" in the OFFICIAL_DOC, but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges. You need to read the OFFICIAL_DOC to figure out if the suggestion includes these values which exists in the official document implicitly, unit conversion may be considered in this process. 
I need you to return the three suggestions in the same json format.      

Step 1: Read the OFFICIAL_DOC especially the "max_val", "min_val" and "unit". Figure out the actual min_value, max_value. Note that sometimes "min_val and "max_val" are not the actual min_value and max_value, they need to be computed considering "unit" which is the actual unit of the "max_val", "min_val".
Step 2: Figure out if the suggestions contain any numerical value that is the same as one of your computed min_value and max_value in Step 2. If so, remove them.
Step 3: Rewrite the suggestion so that it does not include any information about "min_val" and "max_val", but it should contain all the other information included in the corresponding original information especially some suggested values or ranges.
