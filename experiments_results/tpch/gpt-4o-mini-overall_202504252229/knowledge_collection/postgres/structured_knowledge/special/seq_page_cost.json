Research if setting 'seq_page_cost' to any special values changes its behavior significantly compared to regular numerical settings. 5. Conclude that 'seq_page_cost' does not have special values that alter its fundamental operation, thus it does not qualify as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
