{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' is used to control the delay between vacuum operations in PostgreSQL. It is a numerical setting that typically has a range of values representing milliseconds. However, it does not have a special value like -1 or 0 that alters its fundamental behavior. Instead, it functions normally by delaying the vacuum process based on the specified numerical value. Therefore, it does not qualify as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
