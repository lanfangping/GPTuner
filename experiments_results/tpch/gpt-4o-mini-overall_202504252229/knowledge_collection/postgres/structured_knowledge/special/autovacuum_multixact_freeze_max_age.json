{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age' is used in PostgreSQL to determine the maximum age of multixact identifiers before a vacuum operation must be performed. The default value is typically a positive integer, indicating the number of multixacts. However, there are no special values like -1 or 0 that would change its fundamental operation. Therefore, it does not have a special function associated with those values, and it operates based on its numerical value. Thus, it is classified as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
