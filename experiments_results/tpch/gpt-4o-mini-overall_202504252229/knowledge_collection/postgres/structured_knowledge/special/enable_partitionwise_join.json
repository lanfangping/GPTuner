{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_partitionwise_join' controls whether partition-wise joins are enabled in PostgreSQL. It typically takes a boolean value (true or false) to enable or disable this feature. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that change its function significantly, as it directly affects the join behavior. Therefore, it does not break the natural order of numerical knobs and does not classify as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
