{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_partitionwise_aggregate' is used to control whether PostgreSQL can use partition-wise aggregation for queries on partitioned tables. This feature optimizes performance by allowing the database to perform aggregation on each partition separately before combining the results. Since this knob does not have special values like -1 or 0 that change its basic operation significantly, it follows a natural order where it can be set to true or false. Therefore, it does not qualify as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
