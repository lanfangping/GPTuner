{"think_procedure": "The default_statistics_target knob in PostgreSQL determines the level of detail for statistics that the query planner uses for optimizing queries. This knob has a natural order as it typically accepts positive integer values that represent the target number of rows for statistics collection. However, it does not have special values like -1 or 0 that alter its behavior significantly. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob without any special conditions.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
