{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_hashjoin' controls whether the PostgreSQL query planner uses hash joins. To determine if it's a special knob, I need to consider its typical values. The usual values for this knob are 'on' (true) or 'off' (false). There are no special values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a different function. Therefore, it does not break the natural order of numerical knobs.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
