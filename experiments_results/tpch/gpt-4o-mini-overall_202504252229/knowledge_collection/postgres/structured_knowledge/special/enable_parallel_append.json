Check the documentation for 'enable_parallel_append' to see if it can take values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a special operation. 3. Determine if setting it to any of these values disables a feature or alters its behavior significantly. 4. Since 'enable_parallel_append' typically controls whether parallel append operations are allowed, and does not have a special value that changes its fundamental functionality, it does not qualify as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
