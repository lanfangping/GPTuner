{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_naptime' in PostgreSQL controls the time interval between autovacuum runs. It is a numerical setting that typically has a natural order as it is measured in seconds. However, it does not have a special value like -1 or 0 that changes its behavior significantly. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob without any special conditions.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
