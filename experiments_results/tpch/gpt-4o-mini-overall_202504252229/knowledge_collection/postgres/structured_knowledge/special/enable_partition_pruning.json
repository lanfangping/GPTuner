{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_partition_pruning' is designed to control whether partition pruning is enabled in PostgreSQL. To determine if it is a special knob, I need to check if it has a special value like -1 or 0 that would change its behavior significantly. The default value for this knob is typically 'on' or 'off', which are regular states. Since it does not have a special value that alters its fundamental operation, it is not classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
