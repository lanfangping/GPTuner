{"think_procedure": "The knob 'checkpoint_timeout' in PostgreSQL specifies the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints. It is a numerical setting that typically has a natural order (e.g., higher values mean longer intervals between checkpoints). There are no special values like -1 or 0 that would disable this feature or change its fundamental behavior. Therefore, it does not break the natural order and behaves as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
