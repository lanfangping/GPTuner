{"think_procedure": "The knob 'fsync' in PostgreSQL is used to control whether the database should flush data to disk immediately after a transaction is committed. The default value is 'on', which ensures data durability. If set to 'off', it can improve performance but at the risk of data loss in case of a crash. The special value 'off' indicates a significant change in behavior, as it disables immediate data flushing, which is a critical feature for data integrity. Therefore, 'fsync' can be classified as a special knob because it has a special value that alters its function dramatically.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
