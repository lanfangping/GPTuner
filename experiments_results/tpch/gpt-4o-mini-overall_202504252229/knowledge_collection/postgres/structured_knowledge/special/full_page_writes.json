{"think_procedure": "The knob 'full_page_writes' in PostgreSQL controls whether full page writes are done to the WAL (Write-Ahead Log). When this knob is set to 'on', it performs regular operations to ensure data integrity during crashes by writing full pages. If set to 'off', it disables this feature, which can lead to data loss in certain scenarios. The special value of 'off' (which can be interpreted as 0) changes the behavior significantly, indicating that it is a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
