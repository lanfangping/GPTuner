{"think_procedure": "The 'wal_level' knob in PostgreSQL determines the amount of information written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL). It has different settings such as 'minimal', 'replica', and 'logical'. These settings have a natural order in terms of the amount of data logged. However, there are no special values like -1 or 0 that would disable the functionality of the knob. Therefore, it does not break the natural order of numerical knobs and behaves as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
