{"think_procedure": "The 'synchronous_commit' knob in PostgreSQL controls the behavior of transaction commits in relation to data durability. It can take various numerical values, including 'off', 'on', 'local', and 'remote_write', as well as special values like '0' (which disables synchronous commits) and '1' (which enables it). The presence of '0' as a special value indicates that it breaks the natural ordering of numerical settings, as it disables a feature rather than simply adjusting a parameter. Therefore, I classify 'synchronous_commit' as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
