{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' controls the cost limit for autovacuum operations in PostgreSQL. It typically has a numerical value that dictates how much cost can be incurred during an autovacuum operation. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that change its function; it simply limits the cost. Therefore, it maintains a natural order and does not perform a different function when set to a specific value. Thus, it is not classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
