{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' is used to control the threshold for the number of inserted tuples before the autovacuum process triggers a vacuum operation. It is a numerical setting that does not have special values like -1 or 0 that would significantly change its function. Therefore, it follows the natural order of numerical knobs and does not perform a different function when set to specific values. This indicates that it is not a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
