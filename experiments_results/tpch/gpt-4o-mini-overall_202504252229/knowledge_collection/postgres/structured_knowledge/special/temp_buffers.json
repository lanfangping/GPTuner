{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob being analyzed, which is 'temp_buffers'. 2. Determine if 'temp_buffers' has a defined natural order. It does, as it represents the number of temporary buffer pages allocated for each database session. 3. Check if 'temp_buffers' accepts any special values such as -1 or 0 that would indicate a different behavior. In this case, setting 'temp_buffers' to 0 disables the use of temporary buffers. 4. Since 'temp_buffers' can take a special value (0) that alters its standard operation, it qualifies as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
