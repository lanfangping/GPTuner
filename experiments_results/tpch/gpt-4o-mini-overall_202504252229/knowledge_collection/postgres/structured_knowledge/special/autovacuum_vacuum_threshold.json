{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' is a setting in PostgreSQL that determines the minimum number of tuples that must be deleted or updated before a vacuum operation is triggered. It is a numerical knob that has a natural order, as higher values indicate a higher threshold for triggering the vacuum process. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior to disable a feature. Therefore, it operates normally based on its numerical value without any special conditions.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
