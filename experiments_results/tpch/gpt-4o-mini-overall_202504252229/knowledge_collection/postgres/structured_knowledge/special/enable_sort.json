{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_sort' in PostgreSQL controls whether sorting is enabled for certain operations. It is a numerical knob that typically has values indicating its behavior (e.g., 0 for disabled and 1 for enabled). However, since it can have a special value of 0, which disables sorting, it qualifies as a special knob. The special value -1 does not apply to this knob, but the presence of 0 indicates a unique function.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
