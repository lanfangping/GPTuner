{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' is used to determine the fraction of the table size that must be exceeded before an automatic vacuum analyze operation is triggered. It has a numerical value that indicates a scaling factor. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that would change its function dramatically. Therefore, it follows the natural order of numerical knobs and does not have special behavior when set to certain values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
