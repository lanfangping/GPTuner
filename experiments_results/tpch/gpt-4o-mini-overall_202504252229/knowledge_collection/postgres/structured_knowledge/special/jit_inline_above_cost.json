{"think_procedure": "The knob 'jit_inline_above_cost' is used to determine the cost threshold above which the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler will inline functions. It is a numerical value that can be adjusted to optimize performance. However, it does not have a special value like -1 or 0 that alters its basic functionality. Therefore, it behaves consistently as a regular numerical knob without any special conditions.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
