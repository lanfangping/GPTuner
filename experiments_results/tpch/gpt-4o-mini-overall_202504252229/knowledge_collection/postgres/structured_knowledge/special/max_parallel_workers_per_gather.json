{"think_procedure": "The knob 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' controls the maximum number of parallel worker processes that can be used for gathering data in a query. It typically accepts positive integer values to define how many workers can be utilized. However, if set to 0, it disables parallel gathering, which is a special behavior. Since it has a special value (0) that alters its normal function, it qualifies as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
