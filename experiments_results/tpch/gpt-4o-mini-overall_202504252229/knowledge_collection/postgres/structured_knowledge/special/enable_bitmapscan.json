{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_bitmapscan' in PostgreSQL is a configuration setting that controls whether bitmap scans are allowed. A value of 'on' (typically represented as 1) enables bitmap scans, while a value of 'off' (typically represented as 0) disables them. The knob does not have a special value like -1 that would indicate a significantly different function beyond enabling or disabling standard behavior. Therefore, it follows the normal numerical order and does not behave like a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
