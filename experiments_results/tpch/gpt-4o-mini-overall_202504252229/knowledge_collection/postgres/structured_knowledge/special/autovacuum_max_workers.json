{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_max_workers' in PostgreSQL controls the maximum number of autovacuum worker processes that can run simultaneously. It is a numerical setting that typically has a natural order, as higher values allow for more workers and potentially more efficient vacuuming. However, it does not have special values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a different function. Instead, setting it to 0 would disable the autovacuum feature entirely, which is a significant deviation from its regular operation. Therefore, it behaves like a special knob because it has a special value (0) that alters its function.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
