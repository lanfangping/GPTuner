{"think_procedure": "The knob 'checkpoint_completion_target' in PostgreSQL is used to control the target duration for checkpoint completion. It is a floating-point value between 0 and 1, representing a fraction of the maximum checkpoint duration. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that change its function drastically. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob without any special conditions.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
