To optimize the 'full_page_writes' setting in PostgreSQL, you should set it to 'on' (the default) for most workloads, particularly if you are using replication or have high write operations, while considering to set it to 'off' only if your system has limited resources and you can afford potential data loss during a crash, but it's generally recommended to keep it enabled for better data integrity.
