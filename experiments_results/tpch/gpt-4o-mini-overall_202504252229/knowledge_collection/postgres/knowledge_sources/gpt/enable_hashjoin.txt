To optimize the `enable_hashjoin` setting in PostgreSQL, you can typically leave it enabled (set to `on`), as it is the default setting and generally improves query performance, particularly for joins on large datasets; however, you may consider setting it to `off` in specific scenarios where nested loops or merge joins perform better based on your query plans, especially when memory usage is a concern.
