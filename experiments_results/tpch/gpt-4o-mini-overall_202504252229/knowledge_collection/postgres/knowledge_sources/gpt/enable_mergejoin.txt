To enable the merge join in PostgreSQL, set the `enable_mergejoin` configuration parameter to `on` (or `true`), which is the default value; to specifically optimize for merge joins, you may also consider adjusting the `work_mem` setting to a higher value, such as 4MB or more, depending on your available memory and query workload.
