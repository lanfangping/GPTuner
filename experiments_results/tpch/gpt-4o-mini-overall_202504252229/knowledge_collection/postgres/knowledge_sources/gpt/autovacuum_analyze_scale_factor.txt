To set the `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` in PostgreSQL, a recommended value is between 0.1 and 0.2, meaning that autovacuum will trigger an ANALYZE when 10% to 20% of the table has changed, with the default being 0.1 (10%), which can be adjusted based on the workload and frequency of data modifications in your specific use case.
