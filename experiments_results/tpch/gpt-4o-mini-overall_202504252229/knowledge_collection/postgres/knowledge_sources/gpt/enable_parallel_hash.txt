To set the `enable_parallel_hash` knob in PostgreSQL, you can configure it in the `postgresql.conf` file with a value of `on` to enable parallel hashing for queries (set it to `off` to disable), but note that this feature is effective primarily when the `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` setting is set to a value greater than 0, and typically, you should aim to allow 2-4 workers for optimal performance depending on your workload and system resources.
