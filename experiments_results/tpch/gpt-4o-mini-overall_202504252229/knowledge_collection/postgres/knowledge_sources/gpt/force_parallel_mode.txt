To optimize the 'force_parallel_mode' parameter in PostgreSQL, set its value to 'on' for maximum parallelism, 'off' to disable it, or 'regression' to enable it only for queries that perform better with parallelism, with a recommendation to monitor system performance and adjust based on workloads, typically starting with the default setting of 'off' for non-parallelizable queries.
