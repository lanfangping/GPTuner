To set the `maintenance_work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL, allocate between 10% to 20% of the available system memory for maintenance tasks, typically using a starting value of around 64MB for small systems and up to 1GB or more for larger systems, while ensuring it does not exceed the available RAM to avoid memory pressure.
