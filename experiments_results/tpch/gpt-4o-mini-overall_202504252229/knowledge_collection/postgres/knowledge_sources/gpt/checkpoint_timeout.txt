To optimize the 'checkpoint_timeout' parameter in PostgreSQL, set its value to between 5 and 15 minutes (300 to 900 seconds), depending on your workload and performance needs, with a starting recommendation of 10 minutes (600 seconds) for typical use cases to balance transaction safety and write performance.
