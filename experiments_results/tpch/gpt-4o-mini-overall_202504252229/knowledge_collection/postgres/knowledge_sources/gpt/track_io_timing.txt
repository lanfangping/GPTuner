To optimize the `track_io_timing` setting in PostgreSQL, you should set its value to `on` to enable tracking, as this allows you to measure I/O timings, which can help identify performance bottlenecks; itâ€™s particularly useful when running on systems with heavy I/O workload or during performance tuning sessions, although be aware that enabling it may lead to a slight increase in overhead.
