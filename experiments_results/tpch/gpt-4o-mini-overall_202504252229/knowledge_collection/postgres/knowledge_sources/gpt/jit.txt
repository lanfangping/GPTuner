To set the 'jit' (Just-In-Time compilation) knob in PostgreSQL, enable it by setting `jit` to 'on', but for optimal performance, consider using a value of 'on' for workloads with complex queries and set it to 'off' for simpler queries or when the overhead outweighs the benefits, typically using benchmarks to find a balance between query execution time and resource usage.
