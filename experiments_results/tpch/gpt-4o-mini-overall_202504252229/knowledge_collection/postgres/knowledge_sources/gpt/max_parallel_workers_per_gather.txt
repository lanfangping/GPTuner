To set the `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter in PostgreSQL, a good rule of thumb is to initially configure it to a value between 2 and 4, depending on your workload and available system resources, while ensuring that the total number of parallel workers does not exceed `max_worker_processes`, which typically defaults to 8; therefore, starting with 4 may provide a balanced approach for many use cases.
