The `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to a value that reflects the number of tuple inserts before an autovacuum is triggered for a table, generally starting with a default of 100,000 tuples and adjusting to a higher value, such as 200,000 or 500,000, for tables with high insert rates to optimize performance based on specific workload characteristics and application needs.
