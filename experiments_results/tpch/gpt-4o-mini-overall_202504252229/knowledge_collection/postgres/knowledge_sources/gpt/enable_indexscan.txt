To set the `enable_indexscan` knob in PostgreSQL, you can adjust its value to `on` (default) to allow index scans or `off` to disable them, with the command `SET enable_indexscan = on;` or `SET enable_indexscan = off;`, but ensure that any necessary performance testing is conducted, as disabling index scans can significantly impact query performance depending on your specific workload and dataset.
