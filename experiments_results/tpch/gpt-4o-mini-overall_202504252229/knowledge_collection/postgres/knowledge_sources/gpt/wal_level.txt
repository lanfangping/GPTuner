To optimize the 'wal_level' setting in PostgreSQL, set it to 'minimal' for basic write-ahead logging, 'replica' for enabling replication, or 'logical' for logical replication, with the typical default being 'replica' for most production environments, especially if you use streaming replication or logical replication, and occasionally consider adjusting this based on workload requirements and backup strategies.
