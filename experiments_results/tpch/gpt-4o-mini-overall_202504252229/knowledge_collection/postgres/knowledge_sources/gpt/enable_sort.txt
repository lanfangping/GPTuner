To optimize the `enable_sort` setting in PostgreSQL, normally you should set it to `on` (the default) to allow sorting operations, which can be beneficial for queries that require sorted results, but you may consider setting it to `off` for queries where sorting is not necessary and performance is critical, though this requires assessing specific use cases and performance impacts.
