To optimize PostgreSQL's `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay`, set it to a value between 20 and 40 milliseconds (e.g., 30 ms) to balance the performance impact of autovacuum without adversely affecting database workload, while monitoring system performance and adjusting as necessary based on observed behavior.
