To optimize the 'autovacuum_naptime' setting in PostgreSQL, it is suggested to set the value to 1 minute (60 seconds) for most workloads, but you can adjust it to between 1 and 10 minutes (60 to 600 seconds) based on your database's activity level and vacuuming needs, with lower values providing more frequent vacuum checks.
