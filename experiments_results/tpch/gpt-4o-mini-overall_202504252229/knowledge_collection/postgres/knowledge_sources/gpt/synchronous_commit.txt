To optimize the performance of PostgreSQL, set the `synchronous_commit` knob to 'on' for maximum durability (default setting), 'off' to improve performance with the risk of losing the last transaction, or 'remote_apply' to ensure that transactions are committed on a remote standby but can acknowledge faster, depending on your specific use case and tolerance for data loss (with numerical implications for transaction latency, such as potentially reducing commit latency by tens of milliseconds).
