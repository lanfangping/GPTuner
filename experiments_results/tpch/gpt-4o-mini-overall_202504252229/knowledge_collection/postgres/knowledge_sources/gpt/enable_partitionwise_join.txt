To set the `enable_partitionwise_join` knob in PostgreSQL, use the SQL command `SET enable_partitionwise_join TO 'on';` for enabling it, or `SET enable_partitionwise_join TO 'off';` for disabling it, with the recommended practice being to enable it (set to 'on') for queries involving partitioned tables to enhance performance, especially in large datasets.
