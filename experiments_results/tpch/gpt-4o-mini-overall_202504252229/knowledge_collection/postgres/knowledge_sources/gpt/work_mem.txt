To set the `work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL, start by allocating approximately 1-2 MB per concurrent query for basic workloads, but for analytical queries or larger operations, consider increasing it to 16-64 MB or more, ensuring that the total memory used by all concurrent sessions does not exceed your system's available memory.
