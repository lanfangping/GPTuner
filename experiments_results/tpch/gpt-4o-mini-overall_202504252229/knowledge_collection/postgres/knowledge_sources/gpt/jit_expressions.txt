To set the value for the `jit_expressions` knob in PostgreSQL, you can typically set it to `on` to enable Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for expression evaluation, which is beneficial for workloads with heavy computation; the recommended setting would be to keep it on for OLAP workloads, while for OLTP workloads, a good starting point might be `off` or `on` depending on the query patterns, with a default setting of 'off' in PostgreSQL versions prior to 14 and 'on' from version 14 onwards.
