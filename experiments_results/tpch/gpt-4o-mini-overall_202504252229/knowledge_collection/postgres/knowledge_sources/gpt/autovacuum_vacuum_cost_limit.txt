To set the `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` value in PostgreSQL, you should generally start with a baseline of 2000 and adjust it based on system performance, workload, and available resources, increasing it incrementally (e.g., by 500 or 1000) if you observe frequent vacuuming or if you can afford higher resource usage during maintenance operations without impacting overall performance.
