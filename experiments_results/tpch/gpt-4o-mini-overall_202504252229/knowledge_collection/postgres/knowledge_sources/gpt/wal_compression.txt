The `wal_compression` setting in PostgreSQL should be enabled (set to `on`) if you have a high write workload and your writes exceed 1 GB per hour, as it can reduce the size of WAL files and improve disk I/O, particularly when combined with a high `max_wal_size` (e.g., 1 GB or more), but it should be tested for your specific workload to ensure it doesn't negatively impact performance.
