To optimize the `enable_hashagg` setting in PostgreSQL, you should allocate the `work_mem` parameter, typically set between 4MB and 64MB or more depending on available system memory and query workload, to allow for efficient hash aggregation operations when enabled (set to `on`), but consider setting it to `off` in cases where query performance is not benefiting from hash aggregation.
