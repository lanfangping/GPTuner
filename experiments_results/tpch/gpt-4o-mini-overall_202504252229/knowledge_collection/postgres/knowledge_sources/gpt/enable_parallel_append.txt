To enable the `enable_parallel_append` setting in PostgreSQL, set its value to `on` in the `postgresql.conf` file, or execute the SQL command `SET enable_parallel_append TO on;` during a session, which allows for parallel processing of append-only queries when the query planner determines it to be beneficial, typically on large datasets.
