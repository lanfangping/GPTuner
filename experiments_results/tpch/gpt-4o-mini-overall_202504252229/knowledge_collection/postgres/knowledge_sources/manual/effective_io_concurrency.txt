The 'effective_io_concurrency' knob in PostgreSQL sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations (ranging from 1 to 1000 or 0 to disable) that the system expects to execute simultaneously, with a recommended starting point being the number of disks in a RAID 0 or RAID 1 configuration, while for SSDs, values in the hundreds may be optimal; the default is 1 on supported systems or 0 otherwise.
