The 'effective_cache_size' parameter in PostgreSQL, which has a default value of 4 gigabytes (4GB) or 512,000 blocks (assuming default block size of 8kB), estimates the size of the disk cache available to a single query, influencing planner decisions between index and sequential scans based on the anticipated workload and concurrent queries.
