The 'autovacuum' knob controls the operation of the autovacuum launcher daemon, which is enabled by default and requires the 'track_counts' parameter to be active; it must be configured in the postgresql.conf file or command line, and while it can be disabled for specific tables, autovacuum processes will still be initiated as needed to prevent transaction ID wraparound.
