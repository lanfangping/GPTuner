The knob 'jit_optimize_above_cost' configures the threshold for applying costly JIT optimizations on queries with a cost exceeding 500,000, with values below 'jit_above_cost' being invalid and values above 'jit_inline_above_cost' likely unnecessary; setting it to -1 disables the optimizations entirely.
