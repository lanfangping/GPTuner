The 'force_parallel_mode' knob can be set to 'off' (no forced parallelism), 'on' (enables parallel execution for safe queries by adding a Gather node), or 'regress' (similar to 'on' but suppresses parallel worker context messages and hides Gather nodes in EXPLAIN output) to facilitate testing under various conditions.
