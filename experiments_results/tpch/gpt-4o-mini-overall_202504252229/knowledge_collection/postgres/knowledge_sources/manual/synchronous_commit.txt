The 'synchronous_commit' knob controls the completion of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) processing before acknowledging a transaction success to the client, with modes such as 'on' (default) for immediate local flush and 'remote_apply' for full visibility on standby servers; in 'off' mode, transactions may report success without waiting, risking a maximum delay of up to three times the wal_writer_delay, while ensuring consistency despite potential data loss in the case of a crash.
