The 'temp_buffers' setting defines the maximum memory for temporary buffers in each database session, with a default of 8MB (or 8 blocks of 8kB each), which can be adjusted before using temporary tables but has a nominal overhead of 64 bytes per block without incurring additional costs unless the buffers are actively used.
