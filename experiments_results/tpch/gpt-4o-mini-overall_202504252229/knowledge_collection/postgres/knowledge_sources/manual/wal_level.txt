The `wal_level` parameter controls the amount of data written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) with the default set to `replica`, which allows for WAL archiving and replication, while `minimal` generates the least volume for faster operations but does not support data reconstruction or replication; the `logical` level further increases WAL volume by including data necessary for logical decoding, and this parameter can only be set at server start.
