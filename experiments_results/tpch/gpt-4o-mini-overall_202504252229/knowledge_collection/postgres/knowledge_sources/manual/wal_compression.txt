The 'wal_compression' knob, which is off by default and can only be modified by superusers, enables compression of full page images in Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) when 'full_page_writes' is active or during a base backup, potentially reducing WAL volume while incurring additional CPU usage for compression and decompression.
