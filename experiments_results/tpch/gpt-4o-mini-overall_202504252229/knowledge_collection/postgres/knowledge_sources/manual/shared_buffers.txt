The 'shared_buffers' setting in PostgreSQL controls the memory allocated for shared memory buffers, with a default of 128MB; a recommended starting value is 25% of system RAM for dedicated servers with 1GB or more, while allocations above 40% may not yield better performance, and it must be set at server start.
