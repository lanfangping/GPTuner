The 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' setting controls the maximum number of workers that can be utilized by a single Gather or Gather Merge node, with a default value of 2 and a setting of 0 disabling parallel query execution; it's important to note that actual worker availability may vary at runtime, and using more workers significantly increases resource consumption, potentially up to 5 times more than a non-parallel query.
