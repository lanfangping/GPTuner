The 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' knob sets the cost limit for automatic VACUUM operations, with a default value of -1 (using the regular vacuum_cost_limit), and when multiple autovacuum workers are active, the total cost limit is distributed among them to ensure it does not exceed the specified value.
