The 'full_page_writes' knob in PostgreSQL ensures that the entire content of modified disk pages is written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) during the first modification after a checkpoint to prevent data corruption during crashes, and while it increases WAL data volume, its default setting is on, and turning it off could lead to potentially unrecoverable data corruption.
