The 'fsync' knob in PostgreSQL ensures data durability by physically writing updates to disk through fsync() calls, and while disabling it can enhance performance, it significantly risks data corruption during power failures or crashes, thus it is advised to keep it enabled unless under safe conditions such as initial database setups or temporary processing tasks, and it can only be configured in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line.
