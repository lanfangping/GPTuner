{'suggestion': 'To configure the `work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL, begin by setting it to a baseline of approximately 16 MB for most workloads, adjusting to 1-2 MB per concurrent query for basic operations. For analytical queries or those involving complex joins, consider increasing it to 64 MB or more, while ensuring that total memory usage across all concurrent sessions does not exceed system limits. Be mindful that if the value is too low, performance may degrade as the engine resorts to using disk, while setting it too high could destabilize throughput during peak concurrent operations. Always estimate potential memory consumption by multiplying the `work_mem` value by the number of maximum connections and a small factor, and adjust accordingly.'}

{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'checkpoint_timeout' parameter in PostgreSQL, set its value to between 30 and 900 seconds, with a starting recommendation of 600 seconds for typical use cases. This parameter determines the maximum interval between automatic WAL checkpoints, which can affect transaction safety, write performance, and crash recovery times. While raising the value may improve I/O usage, it can also lead to larger I/O spikes and longer recovery times after a crash. Therefore, consider tuning related parameters like 'checkpoint_completion_target' and 'bgwriter activity' to mitigate potential issues."}
