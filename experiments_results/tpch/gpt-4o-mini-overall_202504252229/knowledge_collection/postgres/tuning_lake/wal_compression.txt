{'suggestion': "Enable the `wal_compression` setting in PostgreSQL (set to `on`) if you have a high write workload exceeding 1 GB per hour. This setting compresses full page images in Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) when 'full_page_writes' is active or during a base backup, potentially reducing WAL volume and improving disk I/O. However, it is important to note that this feature incurs additional CPU usage for compression and decompression, so it should be tested for your specific workload to ensure it does not negatively impact performance. Additionally, this setting can only be modified by superusers."}
