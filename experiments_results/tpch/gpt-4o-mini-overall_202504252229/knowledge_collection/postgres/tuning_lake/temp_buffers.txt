{'suggestion': 'To optimize the performance of temporary table usage in PostgreSQL, configure the `temp_buffers` parameter to a value between 800kB and 8GB, with the default set at 8MB. It is advisable to adjust this setting higher, potentially between 16MB and 128MB, especially in environments with high temporary table usage. This setting defines the maximum memory allocated for temporary buffers in each database session and can be adjusted before using temporary tables, which incurs a nominal overhead of 64 bytes per block only when actively used.'}
