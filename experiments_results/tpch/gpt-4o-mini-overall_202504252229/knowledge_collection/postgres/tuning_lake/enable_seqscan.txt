{'suggestion': "To enable and optimize sequential scans in PostgreSQL, ensure that the `enable_seqscan` parameter is set to `on`, which is its default state. You can do this by executing the command `SET enable_seqscan TO 'on';` or by adding `enable_seqscan = on` in the `postgresql.conf` file followed by a database restart. This setting allows the query planner to consider sequential scans for full table scans when they are the most efficient option, while still allowing it to use other methods when appropriate."}
