{'suggestion': 'To configure the `jit_expressions` knob in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to keep it enabled by default for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation of expressions, which is beneficial for workloads with heavy computation. For OLAP workloads, it should generally remain on, while for OLTP workloads, a good starting point might be to set it to `off`, depending on the specific query patterns. For detailed configurations, refer to Section 31.2.'}
