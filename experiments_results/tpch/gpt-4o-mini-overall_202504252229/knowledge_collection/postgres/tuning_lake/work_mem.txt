{'suggestion': 'To configure the `work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL, begin by setting it to a baseline of approximately 16 MB for most workloads, adjusting to 1-2 MB per concurrent query for basic operations. For analytical queries or those involving complex joins, consider increasing it to 64 MB or more, while ensuring that total memory usage across all concurrent sessions does not exceed system limits. Be mindful that if the value is too low, performance may degrade as the engine resorts to using disk, while setting it too high could destabilize throughput during peak concurrent operations. Always estimate potential memory consumption by multiplying the `work_mem` value by the number of maximum connections and a small factor, and adjust accordingly.'}
