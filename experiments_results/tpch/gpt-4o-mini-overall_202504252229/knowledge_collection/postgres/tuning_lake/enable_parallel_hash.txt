{'suggestion': "To enable parallel hashing for queries in PostgreSQL, ensure that the 'enable_parallel_hash' knob is set to 'on' in the 'postgresql.conf' file. This knob is enabled by default and allows the query planner to utilize parallel hash-join plan types, but it will have no effect if hash-join plans are disabled."}
