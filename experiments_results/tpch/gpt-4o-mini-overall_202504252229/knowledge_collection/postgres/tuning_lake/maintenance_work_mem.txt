{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `maintenance_work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to a maximum of 10% to 20% of the available system memory, starting with the default of 64MB for better performance during maintenance tasks such as VACUUM and CREATE INDEX. It is advisable to increase this value significantly when the system has large RAM resources, but ensure that it does not lead to excessive memory usage, especially when multiple autovacuum workers are active.'}
