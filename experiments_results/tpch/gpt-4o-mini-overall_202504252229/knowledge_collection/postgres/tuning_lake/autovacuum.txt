{'suggestion': "To effectively manage the autovacuum process in PostgreSQL, ensure that the 'autovacuum' knob is configured in the postgresql.conf file or via the command line. This feature is enabled by default and requires the 'track_counts' parameter to be active. While it can be disabled for specific tables, note that autovacuum processes will still be initiated as necessary to prevent transaction ID wraparound."}
