{'suggestion': "Configure the knob 'jit_optimize_above_cost' to set the threshold for applying costly JIT optimizations on queries with a cost exceeding 500,000. Ensure that values below 'jit_above_cost' are invalid, and values above 'jit_inline_above_cost' are likely unnecessary. Setting this knob to -1 will disable the optimizations entirely."}
