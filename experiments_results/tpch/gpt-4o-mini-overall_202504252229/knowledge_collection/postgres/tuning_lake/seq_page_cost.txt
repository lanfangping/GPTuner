{'suggestion': 'To effectively configure the `seq_page_cost` knob in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 1.0, which estimates the cost for sequential scans. This value can be adjusted based on your specific hardware and workload characteristics, with a common recommendation of around 4.0 to account for the relative cost of random I/O. Additionally, you can set different values for specific tables and indexes within a tablespace using the ALTER TABLESPACE command.'}
