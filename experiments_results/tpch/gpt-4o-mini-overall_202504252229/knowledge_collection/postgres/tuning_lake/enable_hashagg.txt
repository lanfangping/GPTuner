{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `enable_hashagg` setting in PostgreSQL, keep it enabled (ON) as it allows the query planner to utilize hashed aggregation plan types. Additionally, allocate the `work_mem` parameter based on available system memory and query workload to enhance performance during hash aggregation operations. However, if you find that query performance does not improve with hash aggregation, consider setting `enable_hashagg` to OFF.'}
