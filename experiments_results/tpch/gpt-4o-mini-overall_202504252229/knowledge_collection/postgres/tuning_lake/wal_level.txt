{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'wal_level' setting in PostgreSQL, set it to 'minimal' for the least volume of Write-Ahead Log (WAL) data for faster operations, 'replica' for enabling WAL archiving and replication, which is the default for most production environments, or 'logical' for logical replication, which increases WAL volume by including data necessary for logical decoding. Note that the 'wal_level' parameter can only be set at server start."}
