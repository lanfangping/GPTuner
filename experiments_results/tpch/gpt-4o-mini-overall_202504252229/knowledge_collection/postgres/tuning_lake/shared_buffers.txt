{'suggestion': "To optimize the `shared_buffers` parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to about 25% of the total system RAM for dedicated servers, with a recommended range typically between 128MB and 8GB. Be cautious not to exceed 40% of system RAM, as higher allocations may not yield better performance. Additionally, ensure that the setting is adjusted according to the system's maximum available memory for PostgreSQL processes and is configured at server start. For non-dedicated servers, consider performing benchmarks to fine-tune this parameter, as each PostgreSQL instance will reserve its own memory allocations, which relates to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`."}
