{'suggestion': "To configure the 'enable_indexscan' knob in PostgreSQL, you can enable it (default is on) or disable it based on your specific query performance needs. Use the command `SET enable_indexscan = on;` to enable or `SET enable_indexscan = off;` to disable index scans. It's important to conduct necessary performance testing to evaluate the impact of this setting."}
