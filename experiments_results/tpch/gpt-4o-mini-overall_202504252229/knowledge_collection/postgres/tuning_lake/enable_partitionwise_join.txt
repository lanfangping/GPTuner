{'suggestion': "To optimize joins between partitioned tables in PostgreSQL, enable the `enable_partitionwise_join` knob by using the SQL command `SET enable_partitionwise_join TO 'on';`. This setting allows the query planner to join matching partitions when the join conditions include all partition keys of the same data type, which can significantly enhance performance, particularly with large datasets. However, be aware that this may increase memory usage and planning costs, as it can scale linearly with the number of partitions scanned."}
