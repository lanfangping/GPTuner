{'suggestion': "To optimize the performance of PostgreSQL, configure the `synchronous_commit` setting based on your durability requirements and performance needs. Set it to 'on' for maximum durability, ensuring immediate local flush of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) before acknowledging transaction success to the client. Use 'remote_apply' if you require transactions to be acknowledged faster while ensuring they are committed on a remote standby server. Alternatively, setting it to 'off' can improve performance but carries the risk of losing the last transaction in case of a crash, as it allows transactions to report success without waiting for WAL processing."}
