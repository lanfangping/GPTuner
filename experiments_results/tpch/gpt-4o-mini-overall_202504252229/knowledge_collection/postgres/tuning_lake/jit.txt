{'suggestion': "To optimize performance in PostgreSQL, set the 'jit' (Just-In-Time compilation) knob to 'on' for workloads with complex queries, as it enhances query execution. However, for OLTP systems with simple queries, it may be beneficial to disable it, as the overhead might outweigh the benefits. Always consider benchmarking to find the best setting that balances query execution time and resource usage."}
