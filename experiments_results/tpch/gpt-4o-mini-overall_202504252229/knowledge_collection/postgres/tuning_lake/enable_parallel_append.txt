{'suggestion': 'To enhance query performance in PostgreSQL, ensure that the `enable_parallel_append` setting is enabled, which is typically set to `on` by default. This setting allows the query planner to utilize parallel-aware append plan types, enabling parallel processing for append-only queries when beneficial, particularly on large datasets. You can confirm or modify this setting by adjusting the `postgresql.conf` file or executing the SQL command `SET enable_parallel_append TO on;` during a session.'}
