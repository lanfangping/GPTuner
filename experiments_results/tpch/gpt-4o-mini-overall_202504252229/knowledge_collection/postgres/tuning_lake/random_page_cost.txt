{'suggestion': 'The `random_page_cost` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to a value between 1.1 and 4.0, with a common starting point of 4.0 for traditional spinning disks. For systems with solid-state drives (SSDs), it is advisable to lower this value to reflect faster random I/O performance, potentially using a value like 1.1 or 1.2 if the disk technology has a random access profile similar to that of SSDs. Lowering the value can encourage index scans relative to sequential access, particularly in environments with varied cache effectiveness.'}
