{'suggestion': 'To configure the `checkpoint_completion_target` in PostgreSQL, set it in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line to a value between 0.5 and 0.9, with a common recommendation of around 0.7. This setting helps to smooth I/O activity during checkpoints over larger periods, minimizing performance impact, especially on write-heavy workloads. If this value is used for non-streaming replicas, it is advisable to keep it within a low percentage.'}
