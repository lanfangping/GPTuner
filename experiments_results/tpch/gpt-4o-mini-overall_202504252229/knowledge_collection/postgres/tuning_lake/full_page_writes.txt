{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'full_page_writes' setting in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to keep it set to 'on' (the default) for most workloads, especially if using replication or experiencing high write operations. This setting ensures that the entire content of modified disk pages is written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) during the first modification after a checkpoint, which helps prevent data corruption during crashes. Although this may increase WAL data volume, enabling this setting is crucial for maintaining data integrity."}
