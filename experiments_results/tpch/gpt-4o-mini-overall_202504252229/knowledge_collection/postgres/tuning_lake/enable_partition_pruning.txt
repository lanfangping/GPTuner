{'suggestion': 'To optimize execution efficiency in PostgreSQL, enable partition pruning by setting the configuration parameter `enable_partition_pruning` to `on`. This allows the query planner to automatically eliminate unnecessary partitions from query plans during query planning and execution, which can significantly improve performance, especially for queries involving large partitioned tables with selective filters.'}
