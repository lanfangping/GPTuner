{'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL's `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay`, set it to a value between 20 and 40 milliseconds (e.g., 30 ms) to balance the performance impact of autovacuum without adversely affecting database workload. This setting specifies the delay in milliseconds used during automatic VACUUM operations, which can be overridden for individual tables and reverts to the regular vacuum_cost_delay if set to -1. Monitor system performance and adjust the setting as necessary based on observed behavior."}
