{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `track_io_timing` setting in PostgreSQL, enable it by setting its value to `on`. This allows for the collection of database I/O timing information, which can be accessed in `pg_stat_database`, `EXPLAIN` with `BUFFERS`, and `pg_stat_statements`. While this setting is off by default to avoid potential overhead from frequent time queries, enabling it can help identify performance bottlenecks, especially in systems with heavy I/O workloads or during performance tuning sessions. However, be mindful that it may introduce a slight increase in overhead. Only superusers have the ability to modify this setting, and you can use the `pg_test_timing` tool to assess the performance impact.'}
