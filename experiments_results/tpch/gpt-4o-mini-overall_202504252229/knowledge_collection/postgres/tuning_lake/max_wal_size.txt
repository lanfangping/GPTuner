{'suggestion': "To optimize the `max_wal_size` parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to a starting point of 2048 MB, adjusting upwards as performance demands increase and ensuring adequate disk space is available. This parameter sets a soft limit on the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) size during automatic checkpoints, which can temporarily exceed this limit under heavy load or command failures. It's important to note that increasing this value may lead to longer recovery times after a database crash, so it should be raised only if there are no disk space constraints to ensure that checkpoints are primarily triggered by timeout rather than disk space issues."}
