{'suggestion': "The 'effective_cache_size' parameter in PostgreSQL estimates the size of the disk cache available to a single query, influencing planner decisions between index and sequential scans based on the anticipated workload and concurrent queries. It is recommended to set this value to approximately 50-75% of the total system memory available for database operations, or alternatively, calculate it as (system RAM - (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) * 1.1), adjusting downwards if the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL."}
