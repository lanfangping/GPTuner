{'suggestion': 'To configure the `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` in PostgreSQL, you should set it in the postgresql.conf file or via command line. This parameter defines the threshold for triggering an ANALYZE based on the size of the table, with a recommended value between 0.1 and 0.2, indicating that autovacuum will initiate an ANALYZE when 10% to 20% of the table has changed. Adjust this value according to your workload and data modification frequency.'}
