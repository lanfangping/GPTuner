{'suggestion': 'To configure the `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter in PostgreSQL, start with a value between 1 and 4, depending on your workload type and available system resources. For high throughput OLTP systems, it is advisable to keep this setting at 1 or 2 to avoid excessive resource consumption, while for analytical or data warehousing systems, it can be raised, but should remain a fraction of the total cores available. Additionally, ensure that the total number of parallel workers does not exceed `max_worker_processes`, which typically defaults to 8, and consider the impact of `work_mem` on this setting.'}
