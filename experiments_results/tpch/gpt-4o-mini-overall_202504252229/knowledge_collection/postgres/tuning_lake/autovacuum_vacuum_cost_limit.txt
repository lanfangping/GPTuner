{'suggestion': 'To configure the `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` in PostgreSQL, begin with the default value of -1, which utilizes the regular vacuum_cost_limit. A recommended baseline to start with is 2000, and you should adjust this value based on system performance, workload, and available resources. If you notice frequent vacuuming or can manage higher resource usage during maintenance without affecting overall performance, consider increasing the limit incrementally by 500 or 1000. Keep in mind that when multiple autovacuum workers are active, the total cost limit is shared among them to ensure it does not exceed the specified value.'}
