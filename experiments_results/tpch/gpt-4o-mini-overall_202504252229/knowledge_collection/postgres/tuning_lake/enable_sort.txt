{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `enable_sort` setting in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to keep it set to `on` (the default), as this allows the query planner to utilize explicit sort steps, which can be advantageous for queries that require sorted results. However, you may consider setting it to `off` for specific queries where sorting is unnecessary and performance is critical, but this should be done after carefully assessing the use cases and potential performance impacts.'}
