{'suggestion': "Set the `autovacuum_freeze_max_age` parameter in PostgreSQL to a threshold that prevents transaction ID wraparound, ensuring that the pg_class.relfrozenxid field for tables does not exceed this value before a VACUUM operation is triggered. It is recommended to use a value of around 200 million transactions, while also monitoring your system's workload and adjusting the setting as needed for individual tables at server start to maintain optimal performance."}
