{'suggestion': 'To optimize performance in PostgreSQL, configure the `jit_inline_above_cost` knob, which determines the query cost threshold for inlining functions and operators. Set this value typically between 1000 and 5000, ensuring it is not below the value of `jit_above_cost`. Note that the default value is 500,000, and setting it to -1 will disable inlining entirely.'}
