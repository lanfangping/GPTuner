{'suggestion': "To optimally set the 'enable_partitionwise_aggregate' knob in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to enable it (set to 'on') when dealing with partitioned tables. This allows the query planner to perform grouping or aggregation separately for each partition, potentially improving query performance by making aggregate functions more efficient. However, be aware that this may increase memory usage linearly with the number of partitions scanned and can significantly raise query planning costs in terms of memory and CPU."}
