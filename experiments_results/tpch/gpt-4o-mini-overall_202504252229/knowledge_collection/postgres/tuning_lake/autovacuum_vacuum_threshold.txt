{'suggestion': "Configure the 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' parameter in PostgreSQL to specify the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples required to trigger a VACUUM for any table. Set this value to at least 50 for small tables and consider increasing it to 200 for larger tables, depending on your workload and the frequency of updates or deletes. You also have the option to override this setting for individual tables as needed."}
