{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'checkpoint_timeout' parameter in PostgreSQL, set its value to between 30 and 900 seconds, with a starting recommendation of 600 seconds for typical use cases. This parameter determines the maximum interval between automatic WAL checkpoints, which can affect transaction safety, write performance, and crash recovery times. While raising the value may improve I/O usage, it can also lead to larger I/O spikes and longer recovery times after a crash. Therefore, consider tuning related parameters like 'checkpoint_completion_target' and 'bgwriter activity' to mitigate potential issues."}
