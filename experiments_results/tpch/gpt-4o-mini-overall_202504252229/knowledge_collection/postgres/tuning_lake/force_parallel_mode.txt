{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'force_parallel_mode' parameter in PostgreSQL, set its value to 'on' to enable parallel execution for safe queries by adding a Gather node, 'off' to disable forced parallelism, or 'regress' to enable it only for queries that benefit from parallelism while suppressing parallel worker context messages and hiding Gather nodes in EXPLAIN output. It is recommended to monitor system performance and adjust settings based on workloads."}
