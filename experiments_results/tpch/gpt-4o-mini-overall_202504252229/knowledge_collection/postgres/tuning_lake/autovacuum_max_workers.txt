{'suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_max_workers' parameter in PostgreSQL determines the maximum number of autovacuum processes that can run concurrently and should typically be set to 3 or 4 for most systems. It can be increased if the server has adequate resources, allowing for improved database maintenance efficiency. Note that this parameter can only be set when the server starts."}
