{'suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` parameter in PostgreSQL determines when a VACUUM operation is triggered based on the number of inserted tuples in a table. It is advisable to start with a default value of 1000 tuples and adjust it to a higher value, such as 2000 or 5000, for tables with high insert rates to optimize performance according to specific workload characteristics and application needs. This parameter can be configured in the PostgreSQL settings or for individual tables, with the option to disable the trigger if necessary.'}
