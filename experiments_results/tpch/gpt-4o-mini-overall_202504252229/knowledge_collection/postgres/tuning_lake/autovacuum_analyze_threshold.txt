{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `autovacuum_analyze_threshold` in PostgreSQL, set it to a minimum threshold of 50 tuples, which defines the number of tuples that must be inserted, updated, or deleted to trigger an ANALYZE operation. For larger tables or higher transaction volumes, consider increasing this value to around 100 or 200 to minimize unnecessary autovacuum operations. This setting can also be overridden on a per-table basis as needed.'}
