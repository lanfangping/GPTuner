{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'autovacuum_naptime' setting in PostgreSQL, configure the value in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line, setting it to 1 minute (60 seconds) for most workloads. You may adjust this value between 1 and 10 minutes (60 to 600 seconds) based on your database's activity level and vacuuming needs, with lower values allowing for more frequent vacuum checks."}
