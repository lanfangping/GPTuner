{'suggestion': "To optimize the `default_statistics_target` in PostgreSQL, set a default value of 100 for moderate workloads, and consider increasing it to 200 for medium-sized systems or up to 500-1000 for large tables and complex queries with many distinct values. While larger values can enhance planner estimate accuracy, they may also lead to increased ANALYZE time, so it's essential to understand the effects of raising this value based on your system's specific needs."}
