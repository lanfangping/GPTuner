{'suggestion': "Keep the 'fsync' knob in PostgreSQL enabled (set to 'on') to ensure data durability and integrity by physically writing updates to disk through fsync() calls. Disabling it can improve performance but poses a significant risk of data corruption during power failures or crashes. It is advised to maintain the default setting in production environments, while disabling it may only be considered under safe conditions, such as during initial database setups or temporary processing tasks. Configuration can be done in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line."}
