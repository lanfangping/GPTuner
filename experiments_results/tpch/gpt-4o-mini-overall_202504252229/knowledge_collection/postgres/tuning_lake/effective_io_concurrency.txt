{'suggestion': "To set the `effective_io_concurrency` in PostgreSQL, configure it based on your system's I/O subsystem. For systems with HDDs, a recommended starting point is to set it to the number of disks in a RAID 0 or RAID 1 configuration, typically between 2 to 10. For SSDs, consider setting it to a value in the hundreds, with a general guideline of up to 200, as the default is 1 on supported systems or 0 otherwise."}
