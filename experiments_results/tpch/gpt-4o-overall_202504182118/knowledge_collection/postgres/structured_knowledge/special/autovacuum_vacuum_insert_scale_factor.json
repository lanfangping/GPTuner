{"think_procedure": "First, identify if the knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' has any special values like -1 or 0 that alter its behavior significantly. In PostgreSQL, this particular knob is used to determine the fraction of inserted tuples before a table is vacuumed by autovacuum. Check the PostgreSQL documentation for any notes on special values. Typically, a scale factor is a positive decimal. If there are no special instructions for values like -1 or 0, it is likely not a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
