{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_partitionwise_join' in PostgreSQL is used to control whether the planner should consider partitionwise joins. First, identify if the knob has numerical values or is a boolean setting. 'enable_partitionwise_join' is a boolean setting, which means it takes on values like 'on/off' or 'true/false'. Next, determine if there are any special values that alter its behavior significantly beyond the regular binary operation. Since this knob is boolean, it does not have special numerical values like -1 or 0 that change its function drastically. Therefore, it does not fit the description of a 'special' numerical knob with special values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
