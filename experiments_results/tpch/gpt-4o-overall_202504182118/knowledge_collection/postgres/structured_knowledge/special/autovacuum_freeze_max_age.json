{"think_procedure": "First, identify the purpose of the knob 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age'. This knob determines the maximum age (in transactions) that a table's rows can reach before a vacuum is forced to prevent transaction ID wraparound. Next, examine if there are any specific values that alter the knob's behavior in a significant way. In PostgreSQL, this knob does not have a special value like -1 or 0 that changes its behavior entirely, such as disabling a feature. It operates purely as a numerical threshold for transaction age. Therefore, it does not fit the description of a 'special' numerical knob with distinct values that alter its basic function.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
