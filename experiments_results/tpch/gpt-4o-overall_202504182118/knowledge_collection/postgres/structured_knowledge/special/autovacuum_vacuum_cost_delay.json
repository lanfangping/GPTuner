{"think_procedure": "First, identify what the knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' controls in PostgreSQL. It sets the delay in milliseconds between cost-based vacuum operations. Next, determine if there are any special values that alter its typical numerical behavior. In PostgreSQL, a value of -1 for 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' means 'use the setting of vacuum_cost_delay', which is different from its regular numerical setting. This special value alters its behavior from a numerical delay to a dependency on another setting, thus breaking the natural order of numerical values.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
