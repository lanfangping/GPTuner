{"think_procedure": "The 'default_statistics_target' knob in PostgreSQL is used to set the default statistics target for table columns. This setting influences the amount of data collected for query planning and optimization. It is a numerical knob with a default value of 100 and can be set to any positive integer value to adjust the level of statistics detail. The documentation and common usage of 'default_statistics_target' do not indicate any special values like -1 or 0 that change the behavior fundamentally, such as disabling a feature. Therefore, it operates as a regular numerical knob without any special values that alter its function beyond adjusting the statistics target level.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
