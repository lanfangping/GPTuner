{"think_procedure": "First, identify what the 'jit' knob in Postgres does. JIT (Just-In-Time) refers to the JIT compilation feature in PostgreSQL, which can be enabled or disabled. Next, determine if the 'jit' knob has any special values that alter its behavior significantly. The 'jit' setting in PostgreSQL is a boolean, where 'off' (or 0) disables JIT compilation, and 'on' (or 1) enables it. Since setting it to 'off' or 0 has a special meaning (disabling JIT), it can be considered a special value. Therefore, the 'jit' knob is a special knob because setting it to 0 changes its behavior significantly by disabling the JIT feature.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
