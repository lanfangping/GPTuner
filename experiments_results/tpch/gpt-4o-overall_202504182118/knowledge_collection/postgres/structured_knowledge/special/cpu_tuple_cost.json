{"think_procedure": "First, understand the purpose of the knob 'cpu_tuple_cost' in PostgreSQL. This knob sets the planner's estimate of the cost of processing each tuple (row) during a query. Next, identify if there are any special values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior drastically, such as disabling a feature or altering its function entirely. In PostgreSQL documentation and community resources, verify if 'cpu_tuple_cost' has any special values that change its operation. Typically, 'cpu_tuple_cost' is a straightforward numerical value that represents a cost estimate and does not have special values that alter its fundamental behavior.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
