{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'block_size' is a special knob, we first need to understand its function and typical values in PostgreSQL. The 'block_size' setting in PostgreSQL specifies the size of a disk block, which is a fundamental unit of storage. It is generally set to a power of 2, such as 4096 or 8192 bytes, and is determined at the time of database initialization. Since 'block_size' is a fundamental parameter for database storage and performance, it typically has a natural order based on its size. We need to check if there are any special values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior significantly, such as disabling a feature or altering its standard operation. Upon reviewing PostgreSQL documentation and typical usage, there is no indication that 'block_size' has any special values that alter its function drastically. It is a straightforward numerical knob that does not exhibit special behavior with values like -1 or 0.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
