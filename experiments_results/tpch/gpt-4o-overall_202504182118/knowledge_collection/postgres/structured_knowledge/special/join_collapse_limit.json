{"think_procedure": "The 'join_collapse_limit' knob in PostgreSQL is used to determine the maximum number of tables that are joined before the join order is determined by the query planner. Normally, this is a numerical knob where a higher value allows the planner to consider more complex join orders, potentially improving query performance. However, if 'join_collapse_limit' is set to 1, it has a special behavior: it forces the planner to join tables in the order they are listed in the query, effectively disabling join reordering. This special behavior at a specific value indicates that 'join_collapse_limit' is a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 1}
