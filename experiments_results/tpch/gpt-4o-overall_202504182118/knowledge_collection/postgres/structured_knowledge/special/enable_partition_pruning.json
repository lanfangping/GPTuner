{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'enable_partition_pruning' is a special knob, we first need to understand its function and possible values. In PostgreSQL, 'enable_partition_pruning' is a configuration parameter that controls whether partition pruning is enabled during query execution. It is a boolean setting, typically having values 'on' or 'off'. Unlike numerical knobs, this setting does not have a range of numerical values with a natural order, nor does it have special numerical values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior fundamentally. Instead, it simply toggles the feature on or off. Since it does not have special numerical values that alter its function, it does not qualify as a special numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
