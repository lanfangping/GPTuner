{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the purpose of the 'autovacuum_max_workers' knob in PostgreSQL. It sets the maximum number of autovacuum processes that can run concurrently. 2. Determine if there are any special values for this knob that change its behavior drastically. 3. Check PostgreSQL documentation or resources to see if setting this knob to values like -1, 0, or any other specific number results in a special function, such as disabling the autovacuum feature or altering its behavior significantly. 4. Based on the research, if a special value exists, classify it as a 'special knob'. Otherwise, classify it as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
