{"think_procedure": "First, identify the knob in the PostgreSQL documentation to understand its purpose and possible settings. The 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' knob controls the cost limit for the autovacuum process, which affects the I/O operations it can perform. Next, check if there are any special values that alter its behavior significantly. The documentation indicates that setting this knob to -1 allows it to inherit the value from the 'vacuum_cost_limit' setting. This is a special value because it changes the knob's behavior from a fixed numerical limit to a dynamic one based on another setting. Thus, the knob is considered a 'special knob' because it has a special value that changes its operational behavior.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
