{"think_procedure": "First, I need to understand the purpose of the 'checkpoint_completion_target' knob in PostgreSQL. This knob is used to control the percentage of time between checkpoints that the system should spend writing dirty buffers. Next, I need to identify if there are any special values that change the behavior of this knob significantly from its numerical context. I will review the documentation for any mention of special values such as -1 or 0 that might disable a feature or alter its function drastically. Since 'checkpoint_completion_target' typically ranges between 0.0 and 1.0, I will check if setting it to 0 or any other specific number outside this range has a special effect. After reviewing the documentation and common usage, there is no indication of a special value that alters its behavior drastically outside the normal range. Therefore, this knob does not have a special value that changes its function completely.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
