{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_indexscan' in PostgreSQL is a boolean setting. It controls whether index scans are used in query execution. Unlike numerical knobs, boolean knobs do not have a natural order of values. They typically have two states: true or false. In this case, setting 'enable_indexscan' to false disables the use of index scans, which is a binary decision rather than a numerical adjustment. Therefore, it doesn't have special numerical values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior in a non-binary way. The knob doesn't fit the description of a 'special numerical knob' as it is not numerical and doesn't have special values that alter its function beyond its binary nature.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
