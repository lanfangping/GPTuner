{"think_procedure": "First, identify the purpose and function of the 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' knob in PostgreSQL. This knob determines the fraction of table size that must change before a table is autovacuumed to update statistics. Next, check if there are any special values like -1 or 0 that change the behavior of this knob significantly, such as disabling the feature or changing its operation mode. In PostgreSQL, many knobs use 0 or -1 as special values to disable features or set them to default system behavior. Finally, confirm whether such a special value exists for this knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
