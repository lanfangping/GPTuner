{"think_procedure": "First, identify the purpose of the 'max_parallel_workers' knob in PostgreSQL. It is used to set the maximum number of workers that can be started by a single query. Next, determine if there are any special values that alter its functionality significantly. In PostgreSQL, a special value of 0 is often used to disable certain features. Check the documentation to see if setting 'max_parallel_workers' to 0 disables parallel workers. If it does, then this knob has a special value that breaks the natural order of numerical values, as 0 would mean no parallelism rather than a count of workers. Conclude whether this is a special knob based on this analysis.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
