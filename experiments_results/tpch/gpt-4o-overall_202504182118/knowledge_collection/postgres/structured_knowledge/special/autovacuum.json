{"think_procedure": "The 'autovacuum' knob in PostgreSQL is responsible for enabling or disabling the autovacuum feature. First, we need to determine if this knob has any special values that alter its natural order of functioning. By default, 'autovacuum' is a boolean setting, typically set to 'on' (true) or 'off' (false). In this context, the special value is not a numerical value but rather the boolean 'off', which disables the autovacuum feature entirely. Therefore, while it doesn't have special numerical values like -1 or 0, the 'off' setting serves as a special value that changes its behavior from active to disabled. Since this setting alters the functionality significantly, it can be considered a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
