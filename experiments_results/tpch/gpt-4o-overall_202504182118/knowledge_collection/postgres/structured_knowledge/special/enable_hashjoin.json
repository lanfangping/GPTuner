{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_hashjoin' in PostgreSQL is a boolean setting, not a numerical knob. Boolean knobs typically have two possible values: true or false. In the context of PostgreSQL, setting 'enable_hashjoin' to false disables the use of hash joins in query planning, effectively altering the behavior of the database system. Although it is not a numerical knob with a natural order, the act of disabling a feature by setting a specific value (false) aligns with the concept of a 'special' knob as described. Therefore, we need to consider whether 'enable_hashjoin' fits the criteria of having a special value that performs a different function compared to its regular operation.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": false}
