{"think_procedure": "First, identify the purpose of the 'full_page_writes' knob in PostgreSQL. This knob controls whether the database writes full pages to the write-ahead log (WAL) during checkpoints. Next, determine if it has any special values that alter its behavior significantly. In PostgreSQL, 'full_page_writes' is typically a boolean setting, where 'on' means full page writes are enabled, and 'off' means they are disabled. Since this knob does not have a numerical value with a special function-breaking value like -1 or 0, it does not fit the criteria of a 'special' numerical knob with special values that change its natural order. Instead, it is a straightforward boolean setting.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
