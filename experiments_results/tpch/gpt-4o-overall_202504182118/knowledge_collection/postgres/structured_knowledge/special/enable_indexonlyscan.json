{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_indexonlyscan' in PostgreSQL is a boolean setting rather than a numerical one. It doesn't have a natural order of numbers and doesn't include special numerical values like -1 or 0 that alter its function significantly. Instead, it is simply turned on or off. Therefore, it doesn't fit the description of a 'special numerical knob' that can have special values that change its behavior drastically. This knob controls whether index-only scans are considered in query plans. Since it is a boolean knob, it doesn't qualify as a 'special numerical knob' with special values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
