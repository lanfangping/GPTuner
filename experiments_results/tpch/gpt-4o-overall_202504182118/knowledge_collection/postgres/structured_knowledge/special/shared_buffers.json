{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the purpose of the 'shared_buffers' knob in PostgreSQL. 2. Determine if 'shared_buffers' has any special values that change its behavior significantly, such as disabling a feature. 3. 'shared_buffers' is used to set the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers. 4. Check if there are any documented special values like -1 or 0 that alter its standard behavior. 5. In PostgreSQL, 'shared_buffers' does not have any special values like -1 or 0 that change its functionality drastically; it simply expects a size value in memory units (e.g., 128MB). 6. Conclude whether 'shared_buffers' is a special knob based on the presence or absence of special values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
