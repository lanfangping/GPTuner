{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_work_mem' in PostgreSQL is a configuration setting that controls the amount of memory used by autovacuum workers. To determine if it is a 'special knob', we need to check if there are any values that cause it to behave differently from its natural numerical order. Typically, numerical knobs have a straightforward ordering where higher numbers mean more of a resource is allocated or used. However, some knobs have special values that trigger different behavior. For 'autovacuum_work_mem', setting it to -1 is a special value that means it will use the setting of 'maintenance_work_mem' instead. This indicates that the knob has a special value that alters its behavior significantly from its regular numerical function.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
