{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'wal_buffers' knob in PostgreSQL is a special knob, we need to understand its function and behavior. The 'wal_buffers' setting in PostgreSQL determines the amount of shared memory used for write-ahead logging (WAL) data before it is written to disk. Normally, this setting is specified in kilobytes and has a natural numerical order. However, according to PostgreSQL documentation, setting 'wal_buffers' to -1 uses a special behavior where the system automatically chooses a suitable value based on the system's shared_buffers setting. This indicates that -1 is a special value that changes the behavior of the 'wal_buffers' knob, making it a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
