{"think_procedure": "First, identify the purpose and typical behavior of the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' knob in PostgreSQL. This knob sets the minimum number of tuple inserts required before a table is vacuumed by the autovacuum process. Next, consider if there are any special values, such as -1 or 0, that alter its behavior significantly compared to its normal numerical progression. In PostgreSQL, setting 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' to -1 disables the autovacuum feature for insert operations on the table, which is a distinct and special behavior compared to its normal operation. Therefore, this knob is a 'special knob' because it has a special value that disrupts the natural order of numerical values.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
