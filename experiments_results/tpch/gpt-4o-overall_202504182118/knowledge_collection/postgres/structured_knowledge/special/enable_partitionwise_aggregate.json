{"think_procedure": "First, identify if the knob 'enable_partitionwise_aggregate' is numerical. This knob is a boolean, not numerical, so it doesn't have a natural order of values like numerical knobs do. Next, check if there are special values that perform a different function. For boolean knobs, the special values are typically 'true' or 'false', where 'false' can be seen as disabling a feature. Since this knob does not have special numerical values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior drastically, classify it based on its boolean nature.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
