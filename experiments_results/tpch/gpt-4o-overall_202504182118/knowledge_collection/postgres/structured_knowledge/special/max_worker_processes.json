{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'max_worker_processes' is a special knob, we need to investigate if it has any special values that alter its behavior significantly compared to its normal numerical function. First, we look into the official PostgreSQL documentation or credible sources to check if 'max_worker_processes' has any specific values like -1 or 0 that disable a feature or change its default behavior. Typically, 'max_worker_processes' determines the maximum number of background processes that the system can run concurrently. If a value of -1 or 0 is used to disable all worker processes or change its mode of operation, it would be considered a special knob. After reviewing the documentation, we find that 'max_worker_processes' does not have such special values and operates purely as a numerical setting to limit the number of worker processes.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
