{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_parallel_hash' in PostgreSQL is used to enable or disable the use of parallel hash join operations. The name suggests it is a boolean knob, typically represented by 'on' or 'off', rather than a numerical knob. However, we need to determine if it has any special numerical values that alter its function. In PostgreSQL, some settings use numerical values to denote special functions, such as disabling a feature. For 'enable_parallel_hash', the primary function is to toggle the feature on or off, and there are no documented special numerical values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior significantly from its binary on/off state. Thus, it does not qualify as a 'special knob' with special numerical values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
