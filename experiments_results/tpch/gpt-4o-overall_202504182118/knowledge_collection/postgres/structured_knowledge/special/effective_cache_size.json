{"think_procedure": "First, identify if the knob 'effective_cache_size' has any special values that alter its behavior in a significant way. In PostgreSQL, 'effective_cache_size' is used to estimate the size of the disk cache available to a single query. It is a guideline for the query planner to optimize query execution. Next, check the documentation or resources to see if there are any specific values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior drastically, such as disabling a feature or changing its mode of operation. In this case, 'effective_cache_size' does not have any special values that change its function; it is purely a guideline value for the planner. Therefore, it does not qualify as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
