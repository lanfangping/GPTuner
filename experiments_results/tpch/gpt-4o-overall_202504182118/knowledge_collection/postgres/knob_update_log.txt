For OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) or data warehousing systems, a higher value can be beneficial to leverage parallel processing, but it should be set in proportion to the available CPU cores and the 'max_parallel_workers' setting. Additionally, since each parallel worker functions as a separate process, the total resource usage can increase significantly, potentially up to five times more when a query uses four workers compared to a non-parallel query. Therefore, it is essential to carefully manage related settings such as 'work_mem' to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization."}

[2025-04-18 21:44:25,535 INFO] [knowledge_update.py:filter_knob:126] filter_knob - prompt - default_statistics_target: 
I first give you a knob of postgres, determine if it is related to resources, focusing primarily on CPU, RAM, disk size, and disk type. Note that some knobs may not appear directly related to resources but are indeed associated with them, so please exercise careful discernment. 

let's think step by step

step 1: Summarize the function of  knob from postgres  with no more than five sentences.
step 2: Judge whether this knob is related to cpu, ram, disk type or disk size.
step 3: If the knob is related to any hardware resource in step 2, return the boolean value true, otherwise, return the boolean value false.

Please give me the result in json format.
