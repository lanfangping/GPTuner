To set the value for the 'cpu_tuple_cost' knob in PostgreSQL, consider starting with the default value of 0.01, and adjust it based on the relative CPU cost of processing a tuple compared to other operations, typically in the range of 0.01 to 0.03 for most systems, depending on your specific workload and hardware characteristics.
