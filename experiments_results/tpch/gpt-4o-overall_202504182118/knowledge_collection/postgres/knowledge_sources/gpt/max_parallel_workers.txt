To set the value for the 'max_parallel_workers' knob in PostgreSQL, it should be configured based on your system's CPU resources, typically setting it to half of your system's total CPU cores (e.g., if you have 16 cores, start with 8); however, adjustments may be necessary based on concurrent workload demands and system testing to ensure optimal performance.
