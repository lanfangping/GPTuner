To set the value for the 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, a common approach is to configure it between 0.1 and 0.2, meaning that analyze operations will be triggered after approximately 10% to 20% of a table's rows have been modified. This allows for balance between performance and maintaining up-to-date table statistics.
