To tune the 'jit' knob in PostgreSQL, set `jit` to 'on' if the number of simultaneous queries is low and the queries are complex (e.g., involving multiple joins or aggregations), or set it to 'off' if high query throughput is required with simpler queries, to avoid the overhead of just-in-time compilation.
