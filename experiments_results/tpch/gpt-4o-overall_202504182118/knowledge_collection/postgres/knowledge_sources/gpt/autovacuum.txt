To set the 'autovacuum' knob in PostgreSQL, you should enable it (on by default) to manage background vacuuming, adjusting parameters like 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' (default 50 tuples) and 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' (default 20ms) based on your system's workload and performance requirements.
