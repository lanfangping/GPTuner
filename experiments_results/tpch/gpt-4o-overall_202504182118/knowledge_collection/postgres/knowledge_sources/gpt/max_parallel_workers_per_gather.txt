To set the value for the `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` knob in PostgreSQL, consider the typical workload: for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) tasks, a lower value (e.g., 0-2) is advisable to avoid overhead, while for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), a higher value (e.g., 2-4) can be beneficial to leverage parallel processing, always ensuring not to exceed the total available number of CPU cores or the setting of `max_parallel_workers`.
