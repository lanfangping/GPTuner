To set the 'enable_indexonlyscan' knob in PostgreSQL, you can adjust it by running the command `SET enable_indexonlyscan TO <value>;`, where `<value>` can be either 'on' to enable or 'off' to disable index-only scans, with the default being 'on' to potentially improve query performance by allowing queries to retrieve data directly from indexes when possible.
