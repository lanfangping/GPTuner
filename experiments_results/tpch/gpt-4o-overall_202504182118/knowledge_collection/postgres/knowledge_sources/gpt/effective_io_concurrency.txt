To set the value for the 'effective_io_concurrency' knob in Postgres, it is recommended to match it with the number of concurrent disk I/O requests you expect your system to handle, with values commonly ranging from 2 to 64 depending on disk performance, though a typical starting point is 2 for hard drives and 32 for SSDs.
