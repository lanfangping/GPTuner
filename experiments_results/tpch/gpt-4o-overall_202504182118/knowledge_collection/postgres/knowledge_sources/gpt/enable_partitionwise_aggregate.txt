In PostgreSQL, to set the value for the knob 'enable_partitionwise_aggregate', you typically use the SQL command `SET enable_partitionwise_aggregate = {on|off};` where you replace `{on|off}` with `on` to enable partition-wise aggregation or `off` to disable it, depending on whether you want to optimize aggregate queries on partitioned tables for performance improvements.
