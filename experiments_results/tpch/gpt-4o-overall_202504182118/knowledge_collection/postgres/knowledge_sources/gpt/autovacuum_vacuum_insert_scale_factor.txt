For setting the value of 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, consider starting with a value of 0.2 to 0.5, which means the autovacuum process will trigger when the number of inserted tuples exceeds 20% to 50% of the total number of tuples in a table, and adjust based on workload; if insert-heavy workloads are observed, you may need a lower value to ensure timely vacuuming.
