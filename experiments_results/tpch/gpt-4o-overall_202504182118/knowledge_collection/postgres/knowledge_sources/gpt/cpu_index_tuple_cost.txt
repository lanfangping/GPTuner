To set the value for the 'cpu_index_tuple_cost' knob in PostgreSQL, it is generally recommended to start with the default value of 0.005 and adjust it based on the CPU cost of processing index entries relative to other query costs, testing and fine-tuning as necessary to optimize query performance for your specific workload.
