To set the value for the 'random_page_cost' knob in PostgreSQL, consider lowering it from the default of 4.0 to a value between 1.1 and 2.0 if your database is predominantly using SSDs or if you have a well-cached environment, as this will reflect the faster random access speeds compared to traditional spinning disks.
