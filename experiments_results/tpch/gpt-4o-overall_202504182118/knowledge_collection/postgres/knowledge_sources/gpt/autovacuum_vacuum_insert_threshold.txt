To set the value for the knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' in PostgreSQL, it's recommended to start with the default of 1,000 rows and adjust based on the insert load and performance observations, increasing the threshold in increments of 500 to avoid excessive autovacuum activity on tables with high insert rates while ensuring timely cleanup.
