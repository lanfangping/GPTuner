The value for 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' in PostgreSQL should be set based on the I/O constraints and requirements of your system; a typical starting point is 20 milliseconds, but if your system is under heavy workload or has I/O performance issues, increasing the delay to higher values like 50-100 milliseconds can help reduce the impact of autovacuum operations on active queries.
