To set the 'bgwriter_delay' knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it to balance between write performance and system resources, with a typical starting value being 200 milliseconds, and consider lowering it to around 20-50 milliseconds in high-write environments to improve data flushing frequency at the cost of increased I/O.
