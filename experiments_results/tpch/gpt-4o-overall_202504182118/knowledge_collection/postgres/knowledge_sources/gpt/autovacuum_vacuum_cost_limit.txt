To set the value for the `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 200 and adjust based on system performance; increase it to allow autovacuum to run more aggressively on systems with available I/O bandwidth, possibly around 1000 or more, but decrease it on systems where autovacuum needs to be more throttled to minimize impact, potentially setting it between 50-100 for high-load environments.
