The `default_statistics_target` in PostgreSQL can be set based on the complexity and performance needs of your queries, starting from the default value of 100, which is suitable for many workloads, but for more complex queries, you might increase it to 200 or 500 to improve planner estimates, though doing so could lead to longer ANALYZE times and larger planner statistics.
