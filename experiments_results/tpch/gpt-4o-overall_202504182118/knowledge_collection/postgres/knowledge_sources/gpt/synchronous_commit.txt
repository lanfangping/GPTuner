To set the value for the 'synchronous_commit' knob in PostgreSQL, consider adjusting it based on your durability and performance needs: set it to 'on' for full durability with potential latency trade-offs, 'off' or 'local' for better performance at the risk of data loss during crashes, 'remote_write' for acknowledging commits after data is written to the write-ahead log on the standby server, or 'remote_apply' to ensure commits are acknowledged only after being replayed on the standby, with the default being 'on'.
