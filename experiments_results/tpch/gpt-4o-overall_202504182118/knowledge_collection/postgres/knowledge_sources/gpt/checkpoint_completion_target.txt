The `checkpoint_completion_target` in PostgreSQL should typically be set to a value between 0.5 and 0.9, which determines the fraction of checkpoint interval time used to complete checkpoints, helping to balance the I/O load; a higher value within this range allows for smoother I/O at the cost of increased recovery time in case of a crash.
