To set the value for the 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold' knob in PostgreSQL, use the formula: `autovacuum_analyze_threshold = base_value + (scale_factor * table_size)`, where a common base value is 50, and a typical scale factor ranges from 0.01 to 0.1, depending on the desired frequency and performance impact of the auto-analyze process.
