The 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' parameter specifies that a VACUUM operation will be triggered after 1000 inserted tuples in a table by default, unless set to -1 to disable this trigger, and it must be configured in the postgresql.conf file or server command line, with possible overrides at the table level.
