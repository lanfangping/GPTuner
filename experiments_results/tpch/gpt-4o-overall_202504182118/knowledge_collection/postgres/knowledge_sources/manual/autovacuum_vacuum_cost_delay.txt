The 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' specifies the delay in milliseconds for automatic VACUUM operations, defaulting to 2 milliseconds, with a special value of -1 to use the regular vacuum_cost_delay, and it must be set in the postgresql.conf file or server command line, though it can be adjusted for specific tables via storage parameters.
