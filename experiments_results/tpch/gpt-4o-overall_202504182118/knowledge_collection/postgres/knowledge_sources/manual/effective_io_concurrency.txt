The 'effective_io_concurrency' knob sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations PostgreSQL anticipates can execute simultaneously, with a range from 1 to 1000, including a special case of zero to disable asynchronous I/O; optimal settings vary by storage type, with values potentially reaching into the hundreds for SSDs, whereas magnetic drives might align the value with the number of drives in a RAID configuration, and some operating systems may not support this beyond the default value of 1.
