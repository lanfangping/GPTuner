The 'enable_partitionwise_aggregate' option, when enabled, allows for partitionwise grouping or aggregation on partitioned tables, potentially increasing the number of nodes in the final plan (and thus memory usage) in proportion to the number of partitions scanned, thereby significantly raising overall memory consumption and query planning costs, with its default setting being off.
