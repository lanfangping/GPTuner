The 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' specifies the cost limit for automatic VACUUM operations, with a default of -1 to use the regular vacuum_cost_limit, and this total limit is split among autovacuum workers, adjustable only in postgresql.conf or the server command line, but it can be overridden for specific tables via storage parameters.
