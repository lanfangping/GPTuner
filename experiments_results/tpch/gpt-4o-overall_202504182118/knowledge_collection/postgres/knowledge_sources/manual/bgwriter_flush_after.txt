The 'bgwriter_flush_after' knob, configurable only in the postgresql.conf file or server command line, determines the data amount, from 0 (disabling forced writeback) to 2MB, after which the OS is forced to write to storage; it defaults to 512kB on Linux and 0 on other platforms, typically using blocks of 8kB each, to mitigate latency issues during transaction processing, except possibly for workloads exceeding shared_buffers but smaller than the OS's page cache.
