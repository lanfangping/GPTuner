The 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' setting specifies the maximum number of workers (default 2, can be set to 0 to disable) that a single Gather or Gather Merge node can initiate, impacting resource utilization due to each worker functioning as a separate process, with potential total resource usage, such as memory and CPU time, increasing up to 5 times more when a query uses 4 workers compared to a non-parallel query.
