The "synchronous_commit" knob determines the level of write-ahead logging (WAL) processing required before a database server indicates a successful transaction to the client, with options ranging from "off," where no waiting occurs allowing a delay up to three times "wal_writer_delay," to "remote_apply," where commits wait for confirmation that the commit record has been applied and written to durable storage on synchronous standby servers, potentially causing significant commit delays.
