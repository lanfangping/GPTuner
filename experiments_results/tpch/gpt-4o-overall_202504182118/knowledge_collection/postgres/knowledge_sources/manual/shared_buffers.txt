The "shared_buffers" setting in a database server configures the memory allocated for shared buffers, defaulting to 128MB but potentially less depending on kernel support, and for optimal performance on dedicated servers with 1GB or more RAM, it is recommended to allocate about 25% of total memory, keeping in mind that setting it beyond 40% is usually not advantageous due to reliance on the operating system cache.
