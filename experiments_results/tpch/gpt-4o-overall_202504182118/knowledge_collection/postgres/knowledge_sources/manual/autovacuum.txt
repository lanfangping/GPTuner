The 'autovacuum' knob, enabled by default and requiring 'track_counts' to work, controls the execution of the autovacuum launcher daemon and can only be configured via postgresql.conf or the server command line, although autovacuuming can be disabled for specific tables by modifying their storage parameters; however, even if disabled, autovacuum processes may be triggered to avoid transaction ID wraparound.
