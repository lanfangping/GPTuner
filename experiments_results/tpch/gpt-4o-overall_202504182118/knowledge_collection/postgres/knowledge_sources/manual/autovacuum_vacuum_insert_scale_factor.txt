The `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor` specifies a fraction (defaulting to 0.2, or 20% of the table size) added to the `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` to determine when to trigger a VACUUM, and must be set in the `postgresql.conf` or via the server command line, though it can be overridden for specific tables.
