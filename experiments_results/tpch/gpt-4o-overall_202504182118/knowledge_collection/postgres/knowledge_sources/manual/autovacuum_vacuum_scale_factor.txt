The `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` determines when to trigger a VACUUM by specifying a fraction (default 0.2 or 20%) of the table size to add to the `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`, and it is configurable in the `postgresql.conf` file or server command line, with table-specific overrides available through storage parameters.
