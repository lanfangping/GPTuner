{'suggestion': "The 'enable_parallel_hash' knob in PostgreSQL controls the use of parallel hash-join plan types by the query planner. It is enabled by default. To adjust this setting, you can use the command `SET enable_parallel_hash = on;` to enable it or `SET enable_parallel_hash = off;` to disable it, depending on your performance needs."}
