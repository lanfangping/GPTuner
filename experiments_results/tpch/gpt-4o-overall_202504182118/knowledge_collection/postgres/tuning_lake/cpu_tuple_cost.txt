{'suggestion': "The 'cpu_tuple_cost' knob in PostgreSQL is used to set the planner's estimated cost of processing each row in a query, starting with a default value of 0.01. Adjust this value based on the relative CPU cost of processing a tuple compared to other operations, typically in the range of 0.01 to 0.03, considering your specific workload and hardware characteristics."}
