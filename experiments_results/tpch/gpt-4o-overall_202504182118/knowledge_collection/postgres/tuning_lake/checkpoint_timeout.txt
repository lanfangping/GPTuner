{'suggestion': "To configure the 'checkpoint_timeout' parameter in PostgreSQL, set it in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. The default interval is five minutes, but it can be adjusted based on the system's write workload and capacity to handle checkpoint I/O overhead. Increasing this interval, such as to 15 minutes, can reduce overall I/O usage but may lead to larger I/O spikes and longer recovery times after a crash. These spikes can be mitigated by tuning 'checkpoint_completion_target' and bgwriter activity."}
