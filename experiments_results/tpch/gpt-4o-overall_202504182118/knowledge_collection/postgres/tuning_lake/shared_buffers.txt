{'comprehensive_suggestion': "For optimal performance when configuring the 'shared_buffers' setting in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to allocate approximately 25% of the total system RAM, especially on dedicated servers with at least 1GB of RAM. Avoid setting this value beyond 40% to prevent reliance issues with the operating system cache. Additionally, consider the impact on kernel parameters such as 'shmmax' and 'shmall', and ensure adjustments are made for non-dedicated servers where each PostgreSQL instance will reserve its own memory. If dealing with large memory sizes, such as hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. Conduct benchmarks to fine-tune this parameter according to specific workload requirements."}
