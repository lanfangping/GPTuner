{'suggestion': "For optimal PostgreSQL performance, set the 'effective_cache_size' to estimate the disk cache size available for query planning, taking into account PostgreSQL's shared buffers, the kernel cache for data files, and the expected concurrent query load. This setting should be calculated as the system RAM minus the sum of shared_buffers, work_mem multiplied by max_connections, all multiplied by 1.1. Adjust this value if the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL. This configuration helps the query planner decide between index scans and sequential scans, ultimately improving query performance."}
