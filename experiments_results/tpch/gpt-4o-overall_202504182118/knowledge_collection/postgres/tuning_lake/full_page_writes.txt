{'suggestion': "To ensure data integrity and reliable crash recovery in PostgreSQL, set the 'full_page_writes' parameter to 'on'. This default setting writes the entire content of each disk page to the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) after a checkpoint's first page modification. Although this increases write volume, it is crucial for environments without guaranteed power loss protection. Adjust this setting in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line to maintain optimal database performance and data safety."}
