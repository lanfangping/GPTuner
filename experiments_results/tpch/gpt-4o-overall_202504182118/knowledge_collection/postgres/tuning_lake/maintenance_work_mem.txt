{'suggestion': "To optimize maintenance tasks such as VACUUM and CREATE INDEX in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to increase the 'maintenance_work_mem' setting from its default of 64MB. Allocate a larger proportion of available memory, potentially up to 1GB, depending on your server resources, workload, and dataset size. This adjustment will enhance performance, particularly with large RAM resources and frequent write operations. Keep in mind that unless controlled by 'autovacuum_work_mem', this setting also determines the memory each autovacuum worker might use, leading to a significant collective memory allocation."}
