{'suggestion': "The 'enable_partitionwise_join' setting in PostgreSQL, when enabled, allows the optimizer to consider partitionwise joins between suitable partitioned tables. This can increase the number of nodes and overall memory usage in relation to the number of partitions, potentially making query planning more memory and CPU-intensive. The default setting for this option is 'off'."}
