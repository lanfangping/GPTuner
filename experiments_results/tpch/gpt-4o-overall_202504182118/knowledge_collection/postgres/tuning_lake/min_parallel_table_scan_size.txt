{'suggestion': "The 'min_parallel_table_scan_size' parameter in PostgreSQL defines the minimum table data required to initiate a parallel scan. It defaults to 8 megabytes (8MB), with the block size typically being 8kB when specified without units. To optimize scan operations, this setting should be adjusted based on workload characteristics and performance testing to find a balance between the performance benefits of parallelism and the overhead it introduces."}
