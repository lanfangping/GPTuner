{'suggestion': "To configure the 'bgwriter_flush_after' knob in PostgreSQL, which can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or server command line, determine the amount of data to be written by the background writer before forcing the OS to write to storage. This setting helps mitigate latency issues during transaction processing. The default value is 512kB on Linux and 0 on other platforms, typically using 8kB blocks. Adjust this value based on system performance and specific workload demands, particularly if workloads exceed shared_buffers but are smaller than the OS's page cache."}
