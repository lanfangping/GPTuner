{'suggestion': "For optimal performance in PostgreSQL, the 'jit' knob, which controls the use of just-in-time (JIT) compilation, should generally be left 'on' as it is by default. However, if your system is handling Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) with simple queries, it may be beneficial to disable JIT to reduce unnecessary overhead. Consider the complexity and nature of your queries when deciding whether to enable or disable JIT, keeping it 'on' for complex queries with low concurrency and 'off' for simple, high-throughput queries."}
