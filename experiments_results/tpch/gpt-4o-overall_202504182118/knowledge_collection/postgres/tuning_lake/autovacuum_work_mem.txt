{'suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_work_mem' setting in PostgreSQL should be configured to specify the maximum memory allocation for each autovacuum worker. The default is -1, which utilizes the 'maintenance_work_mem' setting. It is important to note that setting 'autovacuum_work_mem' above 1GB does not improve the capacity for collecting dead tuples. Adjust this setting based on your system's available memory and workload requirements to ensure efficient operation of autovacuum processes without causing unnecessary memory pressure."}
