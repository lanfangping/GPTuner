{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, set it to a default value of 0.2 (20% of the table size), which is added to the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' to determine when to trigger a VACUUM. This value should be specified in the 'postgresql.conf' file or via the server command line, but it can also be overridden for specific tables if needed. Adjust the scale factor based on your workload; for insert-heavy workloads, a lower value may be necessary to ensure timely vacuuming."}
