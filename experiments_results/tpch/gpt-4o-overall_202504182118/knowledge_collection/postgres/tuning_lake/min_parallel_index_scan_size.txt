{'suggestion': "To configure the 'min_parallel_index_scan_size' knob in PostgreSQL, set the threshold for the index data to be scanned to determine whether a parallel scan is feasible or if an index can participate in a parallel vacuum. This size is specified in blocks, typically 8kB each if units aren't given. Consider your system's performance and the typical size of your indexable data when setting this value."}
