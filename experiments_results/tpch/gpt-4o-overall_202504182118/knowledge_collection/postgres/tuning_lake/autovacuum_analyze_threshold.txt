{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold' parameter in PostgreSQL, it defines the minimum number of changes required to trigger an ANALYZE operation on a table. This parameter can be set in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line, and can also be adjusted on a per-table basis using storage parameters. The threshold is calculated using the formula: `autovacuum_analyze_threshold = base_value + (scale_factor * table_size)`, where a common base value is 50. The scale factor typically ranges from 0.01 to 0.1, allowing adjustments based on the desired frequency and performance impact of the auto-analyze process."}
