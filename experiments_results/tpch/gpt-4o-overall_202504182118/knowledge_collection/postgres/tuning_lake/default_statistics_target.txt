{'suggestion': "Set the 'default_statistics_target' in PostgreSQL to optimize query performance based on your system size and complexity. The default value is 100, which is generally sufficient, but for medium-sized systems, consider increasing it to around 200. For larger systems, you may need to raise it to 500 or even 1000 to improve planner estimate quality. Be aware that higher values can lead to longer ANALYZE times and larger planner statistics. Ensure you understand the implications of adjusting this setting to balance performance and resource usage effectively."}
