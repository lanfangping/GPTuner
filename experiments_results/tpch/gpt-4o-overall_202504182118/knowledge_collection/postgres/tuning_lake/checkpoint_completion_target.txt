{'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance, configure the 'checkpoint_completion_target' in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. This setting specifies the fraction of time used to complete checkpoints between intervals, balancing I/O load. It is advisable to set this value between 0.5 and 0.9, with a higher value smoothing I/O at the cost of increased recovery time in case of a crash. For development instances, setting it to 0.9 is common. However, if the setting is used to support non-streaming replicas, maintain a lower percentage to ensure efficient operation."}
