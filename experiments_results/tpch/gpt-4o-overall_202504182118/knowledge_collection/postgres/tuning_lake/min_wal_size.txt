{'suggestion': "To configure the 'min_wal_size' parameter in PostgreSQL, which defaults to 80 MB, ensure it is set in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. This parameter ensures that old WAL files are recycled at checkpoints instead of removed, provided disk usage is below the set value. Consider starting with a value that is 25% of the 'max_wal_size' and adjust based on your workload's write activity and performance needs. If disk space is not a significant concern, consider setting it up to 1GB for better performance."}
