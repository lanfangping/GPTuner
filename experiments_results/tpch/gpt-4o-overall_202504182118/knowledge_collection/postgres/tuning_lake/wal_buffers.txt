{'suggestion': "The 'wal_buffers' setting in PostgreSQL should be configured to allocate shared memory for unwritten WAL data. By default, this is set to approximately 3% of 'shared_buffers', equivalent to 1/32nd. It is advisable to configure it to at least a few megabytes to improve performance on busy servers. This setting can only be adjusted at server start."}
