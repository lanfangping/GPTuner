{'suggestion': "For optimizing PostgreSQL performance, particularly when using SSDs or in highly cached environments, adjust the 'random_page_cost' knob from its default value of 4.0 to around 1.1. This change accounts for the faster random access speeds of SSDs and aligns with environments where the random read cost is close to that of sequential access, reflecting assumptions like a 90% cache hit rate for random reads."}
