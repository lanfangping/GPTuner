{'suggestion': "The 'parallel_tuple_cost' in PostgreSQL should be configured to set the planner's cost estimate for transferring one tuple between parallel worker processes. It is recommended to start with the default value of 0.1, which acts as a baseline. Adjustments can be made based on the complexity and size of the tuples being processed, with higher values discouraging the use of parallelism for less costly operations."}
