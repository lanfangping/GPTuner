{'suggestion': "Configure the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' parameter in PostgreSQL to manage transaction ID wraparound effectively. This setting, which defaults to 200 million transactions, triggers a forced VACUUM to prevent transaction ID wraparound. It must be set at server start, but can be reduced for specific tables using storage parameters. Adjust this setting based on your system's performance and workload patterns to ensure optimal operation."}
