{'suggestion': "For setting the 'join_collapse_limit' in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to match it with 'from_collapse_limit' to determine the maximum number of items a planner will collapse an explicit JOIN construct into. This default setting allows for automatic reordering to optimize efficiency. Advanced users can adjust it to maintain explicit join order in queries if desired. Be cautious, as setting 'join_collapse_limit' equal to or above 'geqo_threshold' may invoke the GEQO planner. While the default settings are generally efficient, increasing the limit may be beneficial if your queries involve numerous joins and maintaining execution plan quality is crucial."}
