{'suggestion': "To configure the `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` in PostgreSQL, it is advisable to start with the default value of 0.2, which triggers vacuuming when 20% of a table's rows have been updated or deleted. This setting can be adjusted down to as low as 0.01 for tables with high data churn to ensure more frequent vacuuming. The parameter is configurable in the `postgresql.conf` file or via the server command line, and table-specific overrides can be set using storage parameters. Consider adjusting the value upward if disk space is not a constraint to balance performance and resource usage."}
