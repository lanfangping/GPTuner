{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_max_workers' setting in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to set it to a default of three, which can only be adjusted at server startup. For small to medium databases, this default is generally suitable, while larger databases with heavy transaction loads may benefit from increasing this value to 5 or more, ensuring it aligns with your system's CPU and IO capacity. Additionally, consider the impact on I/O activity and adjust accordingly to maintain smooth operations, especially if the setting is used to support non-streaming replicas. On development instances, it is common to keep this value low."}
