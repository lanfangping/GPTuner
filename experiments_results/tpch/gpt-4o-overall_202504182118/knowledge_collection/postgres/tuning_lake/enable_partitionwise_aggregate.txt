{'suggestion': "In PostgreSQL, the 'enable_partitionwise_aggregate' option can be configured using the SQL command `SET enable_partitionwise_aggregate = {on|off};`. By enabling this option, you allow for partition-wise grouping or aggregation on partitioned tables, which can optimize aggregate queries for performance improvements. However, note that this may increase the number of nodes in the final plan, leading to higher memory usage and query planning costs in proportion to the number of partitions scanned. The default setting for this option is 'off'."}
