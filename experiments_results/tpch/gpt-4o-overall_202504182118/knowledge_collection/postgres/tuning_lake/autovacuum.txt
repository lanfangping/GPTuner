{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum' knob in PostgreSQL, ensure it is enabled by default, as it requires 'track_counts' to function properly. This knob controls the autovacuum launcher daemon, which can be configured via postgresql.conf or the server command line. While autovacuuming can be disabled for specific tables by modifying their storage parameters, it is important to note that autovacuum processes might still be triggered to prevent transaction ID wraparound. Adjust parameters like 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' and 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' according to your system's workload and performance needs."}
