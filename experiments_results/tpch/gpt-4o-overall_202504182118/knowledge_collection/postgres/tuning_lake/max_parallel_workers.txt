{'suggestion': "To configure the 'max_parallel_workers' parameter in PostgreSQL for optimal performance, set it to a maximum of 8 workers by default. Adjust this setting in conjunction with 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers' and 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' to ensure it complements your system's resources and workload demands. It is important that 'max_parallel_workers' does not exceed the limit set by 'max_worker_processes'. Begin with these settings and conduct system testing to fine-tune the configuration based on actual performance and concurrent workload requirements."}
