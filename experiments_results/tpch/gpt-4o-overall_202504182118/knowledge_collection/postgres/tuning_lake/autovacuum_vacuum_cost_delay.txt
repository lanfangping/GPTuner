{'suggestion': "Set the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' in PostgreSQL to manage the delay for automatic VACUUM operations. The default is 2 milliseconds, but it can be adjusted based on system requirements and I/O constraints. For systems with heavy workloads or I/O performance issues, consider increasing the delay to reduce the impact on active queries. This setting should be configured in the postgresql.conf file or server command line, and can be adjusted for specific tables using storage parameters. A special value of -1 can be used to apply the regular vacuum_cost_delay."}
