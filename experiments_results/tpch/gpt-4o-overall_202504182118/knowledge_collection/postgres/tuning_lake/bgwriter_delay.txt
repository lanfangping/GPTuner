{'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL's 'bgwriter_delay' parameter, which defaults to 200 milliseconds, adjust it to control the frequency of writing dirty buffers. This parameter is crucial for balancing write performance and system resources. On busy systems, consider reducing 'bgwriter_delay' to increase background writer activity, keeping in mind that the effective resolution is typically 10 milliseconds on many systems. This adjustment should be made in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line, with values set in multiples of 10 milliseconds to ensure proper system recognition and performance tuning."}
