{'suggestion': "To optimize transaction latency and disk I/O in PostgreSQL, configure the 'checkpoint_flush_after' knob to specify the amount of data that triggers the operating system to write to storage during a checkpoint. The default setting is 256kB on Linux and 0 elsewhere. This setting can only be adjusted through the postgresql.conf file or the server command line."}
