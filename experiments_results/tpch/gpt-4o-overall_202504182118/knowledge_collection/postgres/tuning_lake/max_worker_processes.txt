{'suggestion': "To configure the 'max_worker_processes' in PostgreSQL, it is essential to set it at server start to support the maximum number of background processes, with a default of 8. Ensure this value is equal to or greater than that on the master server to maintain standby query functionality. Additionally, consider adjusting related parameters such as max_parallel_workers, max_parallel_maintenance_workers, and max_parallel_workers_per_gather. While setting this value, take into account the number of CPU cores and specific workload requirements, aiming for a balance where system resources are not overcommitted."}
