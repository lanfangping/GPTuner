{'suggestion': "To configure the 'synchronous_commit' setting in PostgreSQL, determine the appropriate level of write-ahead logging (WAL) processing based on your durability and performance requirements. Options include 'off' for no waiting and potential performance gains at the risk of data loss during crashes, and 'remote_apply' for maximum durability by waiting for confirmation that commit records are applied and written to durable storage on synchronous standby servers, which may cause significant commit delays. Adjust this setting to balance between performance and data safety according to your specific needs."}
