{'suggestion': "When configuring the 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' setting in PostgreSQL, it is important to consider the type of workload and the available system resources. For OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems, it is advisable to set this value to 1 or 2 to minimize overhead and resource consumption. For OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) or data warehousing systems, a higher value can be beneficial to leverage parallel processing, but it should be set in proportion to the available CPU cores and the 'max_parallel_workers' setting. Additionally, since each parallel worker functions as a separate process, the total resource usage can increase significantly, potentially up to five times more when a query uses four workers compared to a non-parallel query. Therefore, it is essential to carefully manage related settings such as 'work_mem' to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization."}
