{'suggestion': "The 'enable_partition_pruning' knob in PostgreSQL is crucial for optimizing query performance by allowing the query planner to exclude unnecessary partitions from query plans. This feature is enabled by default, as detailed in Section 5.11.4. To manage this setting, you can use the command `SET enable_partition_pruning = on;` to ensure it is enabled for all queries, thereby enhancing efficiency when handling partitioned tables."}
