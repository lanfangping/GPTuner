{'suggestion': "The 'cpu_operator_cost' parameter in PostgreSQL is used by the planner to estimate the cost of processing each operator or function in a query. It is important to start with the default value of 0.0025 and adjust it based on the CPU cost relative to I/O operations. If your queries are CPU-bound, consider increasing this value to ensure the planner selects efficient query plans."}
