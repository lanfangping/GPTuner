{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' parameter in PostgreSQL, it should be set in the postgresql.conf file or server command line, with the option for table-level overrides. This parameter specifies when a VACUUM operation will be triggered after a certain number of inserted tuples. It is recommended to start with the default threshold of 1,000 rows and adjust based on the insert load and performance observations. Increase the threshold in increments of 500 to manage autovacuum activity effectively, ensuring timely cleanup without excessive activity on tables with high insert rates."}
