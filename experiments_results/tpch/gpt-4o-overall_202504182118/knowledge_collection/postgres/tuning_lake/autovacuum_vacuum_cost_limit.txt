{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' in PostgreSQL, set it in the postgresql.conf file or the server command line, as it determines the cost limit for automatic VACUUM operations. The default value is -1, which means it uses the regular vacuum_cost_limit. This total limit is shared among autovacuum workers but can be adjusted and overridden for specific tables through storage parameters. Begin with the default setting and monitor system performance; increase the value to allow more aggressive autovacuum operations on systems with available I/O bandwidth, potentially around 1000 or more. Conversely, decrease it for systems requiring more throttling to minimize impact, possibly setting it to 50 in high-load environments."}
