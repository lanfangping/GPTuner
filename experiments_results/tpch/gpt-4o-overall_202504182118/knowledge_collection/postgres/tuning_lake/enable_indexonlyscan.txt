{'suggestion': "To configure the 'enable_indexonlyscan' setting in PostgreSQL, ensure that it is enabled by default to allow the query planner to use index-only-scan plans. This setting requires the 'enable_indexscan' setting to be enabled as well, which is necessary for considering index-only scans. You can adjust 'enable_indexonlyscan' by executing the command `SET enable_indexonlyscan TO <value>;`, where `<value>` can be either 'on' to enable or 'off' to disable index-only scans. Enabling this feature can potentially improve query performance by allowing queries to retrieve data directly from indexes when possible."}
