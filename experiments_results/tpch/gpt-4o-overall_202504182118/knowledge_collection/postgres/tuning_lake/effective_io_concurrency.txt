{'suggestion': "For optimal performance in PostgreSQL, set the 'effective_io_concurrency' knob according to your storage type and system capabilities. For SSDs, this value can potentially reach into the hundreds, while for magnetic drives, it should align with the number of drives in a RAID configuration. Be aware that some operating systems may not support values beyond the default of 1. Adjust the setting based on the number of concurrent disk I/O operations your system can handle effectively."}
