{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'work_mem' setting in PostgreSQL, start with a base value of 4MB for query operations such as sorts or hash tables. This default can be adjusted higher for larger queries, especially in OLAP environments, where few concurrent queries may require settings in the GB range. For OLTP queries with simpler operations, lower settings in the low MBs are sufficient. It is crucial to consider the total memory usage, as multiple operations or sessions can increase it significantly. Use the formula of max_connections multiplied by a small single-digit number to estimate the potential maximum memory consumed by the PostgreSQL process. Adjust the 'work_mem' value based on system memory availability and query requirements, ensuring not to overcommit memory, which could destabilize the system. Consider increasing the default value as it's often too low for modern systems, with 16MB being a recommended starting point for most users."}
