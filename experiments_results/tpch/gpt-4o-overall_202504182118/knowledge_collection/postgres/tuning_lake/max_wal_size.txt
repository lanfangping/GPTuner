{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure the 'max_wal_size' parameter in PostgreSQL, start with the default setting of 1GB and adjust it upwards based on workload and available disk space. This parameter sets a soft limit for WAL growth during automatic checkpoints and can only be adjusted via the postgresql.conf file or server command line. Increasing the 'max_wal_size' reduces the frequency of checkpoints, which optimizes performance, but also increases the recovery time after a crash. Adjust this value carefully, ensuring that automatic checkpoints are primarily triggered by timeout rather than disk space constraints."}
