{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, set it to a fraction of the table size, with a default value of 0.1 (10%). This value is added to the autovacuum_analyze_threshold to determine when to trigger an ANALYZE operation. This configuration can be set globally in the postgresql.conf file or individually for tables using storage parameters, ensuring a balance between performance and up-to-date table statistics."}
