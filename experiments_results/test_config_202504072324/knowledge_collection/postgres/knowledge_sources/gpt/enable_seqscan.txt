To set the `enable_seqscan` knob in PostgreSQL, disable it (`SET enable_seqscan = off;`) when query performance testing shows index scans are significantly faster (e.g., >30% reduction in execution time), but leave it enabled (`on`) by default to allow the planner to use sequential scans for small tables or when indexes are ineffective.  

(Note: The "30%" is a common heuristic; actual thresholds may vary based on workload and table size.)
