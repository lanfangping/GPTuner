To set `max_locks_per_transaction` in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on the expected workload: for typical OLTP systems, a value of **64–128** is often sufficient, but for high-concurrency or complex transactional workloads (e.g., many tables/indexes accessed per transaction), increase it to **256–1024** or higher, ensuring it aligns with `max_connections × max_locks_per_transaction` not exceeding the system's shared memory limits.
