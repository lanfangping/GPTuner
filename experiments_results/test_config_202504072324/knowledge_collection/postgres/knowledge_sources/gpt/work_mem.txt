To set the `work_mem` knob in PostgreSQL, allocate **4MB–64MB per operation** (e.g., **4MB** for OLTP, **16MB–64MB** for analytics), ensuring the total (`work_mem × max_worker_processes × max_connections`) stays below **25% of RAM** to avoid overcommitment. Adjust based on query complexity and system resources.  

*(Example: For a system with 16GB RAM and 100 connections, limit `work_mem` to ~40MB per operation: `(0.25 × 16GB) / (100 × 1 worker) ≈ 40MB`.)*
