To set the `track_activities` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it by setting `track_activities = on` (default) to monitor active queries per session, or disable it with `off` if performance overhead is a concern (though the impact is minimal, typically <1% CPU). No numeric tuning is required—it’s a boolean parameter.
