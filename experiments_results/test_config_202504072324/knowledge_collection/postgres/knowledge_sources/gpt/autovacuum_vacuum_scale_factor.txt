To set `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor`, a typical starting value is **0.2** (20% of dead tuples trigger autovacuum), but for large tables (e.g., >10GB), reduce it to **0.05–0.1** (5–10%) to avoid excessive delays, while for small tables (<1GB), a higher value like **0.5** (50%) may suffice to reduce overhead. Adjust based on monitoring table bloat and autovacuum frequency.  

*(Note: Values assume default `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` of 50 tuples.)*
