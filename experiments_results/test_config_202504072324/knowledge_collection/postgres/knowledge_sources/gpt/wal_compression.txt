To set the `wal_compression` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (`on`) if you want to reduce WAL size (typically achieving 30-70% compression for text-heavy workloads) or disable it (`off`) if CPU overhead is a concern, with `level` values (1-9) allowing trade-offs between speed (1 = fastest, less compression) and ratio (9 = slowest, best compression). Default is `off`; consider testing with `level=1` (low CPU impact) or `level=6` (balanced) for active databases.
