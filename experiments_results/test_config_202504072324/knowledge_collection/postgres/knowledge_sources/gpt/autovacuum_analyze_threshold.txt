To set `autovacuum_analyze_threshold`, configure it as **50 plus 10% of `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` multiplied by the table's row count** (e.g., for a 100k-row table with default scale factor 0.1, analyze triggers at 50 + (0.1 × 100k) = 10,050 row changes). Adjust based on write frequency—lower values (e.g., 10–20% scale) for volatile tables, higher (e.g., 5%) for stable ones.
