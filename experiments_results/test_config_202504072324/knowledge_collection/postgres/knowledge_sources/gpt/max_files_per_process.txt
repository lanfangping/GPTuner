To set the `max_files_per_process` knob in PostgreSQL, a common recommendation is to set it to **1000** (the default is typically 1000 on many systems), but if your workload involves many temporary files or connections, you may need to increase it (e.g., **2000â€“5000**) based on monitoring "Too many open files" errors in logs or system-level file descriptor limits (check with `ulimit -n`).
