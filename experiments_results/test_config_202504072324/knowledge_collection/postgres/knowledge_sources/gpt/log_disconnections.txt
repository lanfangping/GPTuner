To set the `log_disconnections` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (`on`) to log session disconnections (useful for debugging) or disable it (`off`) to reduce log clutter, with typical logging details including session duration and user/client information. Example: `log_disconnections = on` in `postgresql.conf`.
