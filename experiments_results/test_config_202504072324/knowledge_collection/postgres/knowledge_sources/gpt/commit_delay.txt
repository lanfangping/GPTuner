To set the `commit_delay` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on your workload: for high-concurrency OLTP systems, start with a default of `0` (no delay) or a small value like `10`â€“`100` microseconds (e.g., `commit_delay = 50`), but for bulk-load scenarios, test values up to `10000` microseconds (10ms) to group commits, balancing latency and throughput while ensuring `commit_siblings` (default: `5`) is met.
