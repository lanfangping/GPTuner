To set `default_statistics_target` in PostgreSQL, increase it from the default **100** to **200-500** for more accurate query planning on large or complex tables, or reduce it to **50-100** for smaller datasets to save planning time and storage. Adjust based on workload profiling and `ANALYZE` performance.
