To set the `wal_receiver_status_interval` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it to **10 seconds (default)** for typical replication setups, but reduce it to **1-5 seconds** for high-availability environments requiring faster failover detection, balancing between replication overhead and responsiveness.  

*(Note: The default is 10s; lower values improve failover speed but may increase network traffic.)*
