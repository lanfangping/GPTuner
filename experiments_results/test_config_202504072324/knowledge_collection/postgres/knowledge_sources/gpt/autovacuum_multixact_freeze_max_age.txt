To set `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age`, choose a value between **100 million (100,000,000)** and **200 million (200,000,000)** (default: 400 million) to balance transaction ID (MultiXact) wraparound prevention with autovacuum frequencyâ€”lower values trigger more frequent freezes but reduce the risk of wraparound failures. Adjust based on workload intensity and cluster size, ensuring it remains below `multixact_freeze_max_age` (typically 2 billion).  

*(Note: The default is conservative; lowering it trades maintenance overhead for safety.)*
