To set the `synchronous_commit` knob in PostgreSQL, choose:  
- **`on`** (default, safest, ensures durability with every commit),  
- **`off`** (risky, boosts performance by delaying disk writes),  
- **`remote_write`** (waits for primary and standby to acknowledge write receipt),  
- **`remote_apply`** (waits for standby to apply the transaction), or  
- **`local`** (only primary durability, no standby wait).  

For example, set `synchronous_commit = off` for bulk loads where speed matters more than durability, or `remote_apply` for zero RPO (recovery point objective) setups.  

(Note: Numbers like time savings or throughput gains depend on workload and hardware.)
