To set the `wal_writer_delay` knob in PostgreSQL, a typical value is **200ms** (default), but it can be adjusted between **1ms** and **10000ms** based on workload—lower values (e.g., **10ms–50ms**) reduce WAL write latency for high-throughput systems, while higher values (e.g., **500ms–1000ms**) may improve batch efficiency for write-heavy workloads with fewer transactions. Always test under realistic conditions to balance performance and I/O overhead.
