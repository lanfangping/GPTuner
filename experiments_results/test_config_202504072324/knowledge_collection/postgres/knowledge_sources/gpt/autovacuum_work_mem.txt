To set `autovacuum_work_mem`, allocate **5-10% of the system's available RAM** (e.g., **64MB–256MB** on modest systems or **1GB–2GB** on large servers), ensuring it does not exceed `maintenance_work_mem` and leaves sufficient memory for other operations. Adjust based on vacuum performance and system load.  

*(Example: For a 16GB RAM system, start with 800MB–1.6GB.)*
