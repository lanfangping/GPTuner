To set the `log_statement` knob in PostgreSQL, choose one of these values: `'none'` (log nothing), `'ddl'` (log DDL like `CREATE/ALTER`), `'mod'` (log DDL + data-modifying queries like `INSERT/UPDATE`), or `'all'` (log all queries), balancing verbosity and performance based on debugging needs (e.g., use `'mod'` for auditing changes or `'all'` for full query tracing).
