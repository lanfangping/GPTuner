To set the `enable_indexscan` knob in PostgreSQL, typically leave it `on` (default) for most workloads, but set it `off` if sequential scans are faster (e.g., when >30% of rows are accessed or indexes are poorly selective). Benchmark with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to validate.  

Example:  
```sql
SET enable_indexscan = off;  -- Disable if seqscan is 2x faster for large scans  
```
