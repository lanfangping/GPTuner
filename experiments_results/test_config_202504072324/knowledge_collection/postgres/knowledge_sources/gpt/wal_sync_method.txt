To set the `wal_sync_method` knob in PostgreSQL, choose a method based on your OS and performance needs: use `fdatasync` (default on most systems), `fsync` (slower but safer), `open_sync` (low latency but risky), or `open_datasync` (optimized for some platforms), ensuring the selected method is supported by your OS (e.g., Linux supports all, while Windows only supports `fsync_writethrough`). Benchmark with `pg_test_fsync` to pick the fastest reliable option.
