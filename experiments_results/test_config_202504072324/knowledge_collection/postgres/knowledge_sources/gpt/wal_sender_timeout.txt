To set `wal_sender_timeout` in PostgreSQL, a common recommendation is **60 seconds (1 minute)** for most environments, but adjust it higher (e.g., **10 minutes or 600s**) if dealing with high-latency networks or intermittent connectivity, ensuring it exceeds the expected replication lag while avoiding unnecessary delays in detecting failures.  

*(Note: The default is typically 60s; values like `60000ms` or `0` [disabled] are also possible but rarely recommended.)*
