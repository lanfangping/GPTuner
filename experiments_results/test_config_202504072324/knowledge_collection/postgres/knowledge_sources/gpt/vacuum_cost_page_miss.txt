To set `vacuum_cost_page_miss` in PostgreSQL, a typical value is **10** (default), but adjust it higher (e.g., **20-50**) if vacuum is too aggressive on I/O, or lower (e.g., **2-5**) to prioritize vacuum speed on systems with fast storage, while balancing other `vacuum_cost_*` parameters and `vacuum_cost_limit` (often **200**).  

*(This reflects a balance between I/O impact and vacuum efficiency, with context-dependent tuning.)*
