To set `autovacuum_freeze_max_age`, choose a value between **100–200 million transactions** (default: 200 million), balancing the need to prevent transaction ID wraparound with avoiding excessive vacuum overhead—lower values (e.g., **120–150 million**) may be safer for busy databases with high write rates.
