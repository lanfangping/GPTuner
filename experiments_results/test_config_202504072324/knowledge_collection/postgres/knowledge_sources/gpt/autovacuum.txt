To set the `autovacuum` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (typically `on` by default) and adjust related parameters like `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` (default `0.2`) and `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` (default `50`) based on table size—for large tables, reduce the scale factor (e.g., `0.05`) to trigger vacuums more frequently, while keeping the threshold low (e.g., `50–1000`) for small tables. Monitor table activity and bloat to fine-tune.
