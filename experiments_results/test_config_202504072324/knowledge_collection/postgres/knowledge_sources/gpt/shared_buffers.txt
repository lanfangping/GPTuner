To set the `shared_buffers` knob in PostgreSQL, a common recommendation is to allocate **25% of available system RAM** (but not exceeding 8GB for most workloads), with typical starting values being **1-2GB for smaller servers** (e.g., 4GB RAM) or **4-8GB for larger systems** (e.g., 32GB RAM), while ensuring the OS has sufficient memory for other processes.
