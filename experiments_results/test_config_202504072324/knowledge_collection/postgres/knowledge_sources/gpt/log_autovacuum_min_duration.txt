To set the `log_autovacuum_min_duration` knob in PostgreSQL, configure it to log autovacuum operations that exceed a specific threshold (e.g., `500ms` for detailed tracking or `0` to log all autovacuum activity), balancing between monitoring overhead and actionable insights. Adjust higher (e.g., `2000ms`) if logging noise is excessive.
