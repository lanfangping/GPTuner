To set the `enable_partition_pruning` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (`on` or `true`) for partitioned tables to improve query performance by skipping irrelevant partitions, or disable it (`off` or `false`) for debugging; it defaults to `on` in PostgreSQL 11+ (earlier versions may require explicit enabling).  

*(Note: No concrete numeric values apply here, as it is a boolean parameter.)*
