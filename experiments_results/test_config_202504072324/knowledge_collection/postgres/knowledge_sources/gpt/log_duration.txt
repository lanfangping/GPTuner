To set the `log_duration` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (`log_duration = on`) to log the duration of every completed statement (useful for debugging), or disable it (`log_duration = off`) to reduce log volume (default); typical use cases might involve enabling it temporarily with `log_min_duration_statement = 100ms` to log only slow queries.
