To set the `track_counts` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it by setting `track_counts = on` (default) to collect statistics on table and index access, which is essential for the autovacuum daemon; no specific numeric value is needed as it is a boolean parameter (`on`/`off`).  

*(Note: `track_counts` is a boolean parameter, so concrete numbers don't applyâ€”it simply enables/disables statistics tracking.)*
