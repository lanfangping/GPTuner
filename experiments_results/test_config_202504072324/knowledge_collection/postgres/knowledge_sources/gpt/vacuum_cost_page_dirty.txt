To set `vacuum_cost_page_dirty` in PostgreSQL, adjust it between **20-500** (default: 20), where higher values reduce I/O overhead by deferring writes of dirtied pages during vacuuming, but balance with `vacuum_cost_delay` to avoid excessive slowdownâ€”e.g., **200-300** for HDDs or **20-100** for SSDs if aggressive cleaning is needed.  

*(Context: This cost parameter assigns a penalty to vacuum for dirtying a shared buffer, influencing how often vacuum pauses to throttle I/O.)*
