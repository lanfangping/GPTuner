To set the `log_line_prefix` in PostgreSQL, use a value like `'%m [%p] %q%u@%d '` which includes the timestamp (`%m`), process ID (`%p`), user (`%u`), database (`%d`), and optional query ID (`%q`), ensuring balanced readability and detail (e.g., `'%t %u %d %a '` for time, user, DB, and app name). Adjust based on logging needs, keeping it under 50â€“60 characters to avoid excessive log size.
