To set the `checkpoint_segments` knob in PostgreSQL (prior to version 9.5), a general rule is to configure it to **3â€“10 times the number of checkpoint segments generated between checkpoints**, with a typical starting value of **32** (each segment being 16MB by default, totaling 512MB of WAL), adjusting higher for write-heavy workloads or lower if disk space is constrained.  

*(Note: In PostgreSQL 9.5+, this parameter was replaced by `max_wal_size` and `min_wal_size`, calculated in MB.)*
