For the `track_functions` knob in PostgreSQL, set it to `all` (value `2`) to monitor all functions (including procedural language and internal functions), `pl` (value `1`) to track only procedural language functions, or `none` (value `0`) to disable tracking entirely, depending on your performance monitoring needs.
