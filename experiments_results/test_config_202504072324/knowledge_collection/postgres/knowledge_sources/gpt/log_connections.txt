To set the `log_connections` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (`log_connections = on`) if you need to log every successful client connection (useful for auditing or debugging), or disable it (`log_connections = off`) to reduce log volume, as each connection generates a log entry like "2023-01-01 12:00:00 UTC LOG: connection received: host=127.0.0.1 port=12345". Default is typically `off`.
