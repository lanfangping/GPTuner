To set the `checkpoint_timeout` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on your write workload and recovery needs: the default is 5 minutes (300 seconds), but increasing it to 15–30 minutes (900–1800 seconds) can reduce I/O overhead for write-heavy systems, while decreasing it to 1–2 minutes (60–120 seconds) may improve crash recovery time at the cost of more frequent checkpoints. Always balance with `max_wal_size` to avoid uncontrolled checkpoint spikes.
