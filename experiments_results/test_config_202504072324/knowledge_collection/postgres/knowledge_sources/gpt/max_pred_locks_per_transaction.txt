To set `max_pred_locks_per_transaction` in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on workload concurrency and lock usage: for light workloads, the default **64** is sufficient; for moderate-high concurrency or long transactions, increase it (e.g., **128â€“256**), and for very complex transactions or aggressive locking, monitor `pg_locks` and scale further (e.g., **512+**) while ensuring system RAM can accommodate the additional lock memory.
