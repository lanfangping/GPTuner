To set `max_prepared_transactions` in PostgreSQL, configure it to **match or slightly exceed the maximum number of concurrent prepared transactions** your application expects (e.g., **10–100** for typical workloads, **1000+** for high-transaction systems), ensuring it aligns with `max_connections` (e.g., **10–20% of `max_connections`**) and is **never left at 0** if prepared transactions are used.
