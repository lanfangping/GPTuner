The 'fsync' knob in PostgreSQL ensures data durability by forcing updates to disk via fsync() calls, but disabling it can improve performance at the risk of unrecoverable data corruption during crashes, with safe use cases including temporary databases (e.g., batch processing or read-only clones) and requiring manual sync methods (e.g., `initdb --sync-only` or rebooting) when re-enabling fsync for reliable recovery.
