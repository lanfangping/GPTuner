"The 'track_counts' knob, enabled by default, collects database activity statistics (e.g., table row counts and modification frequencies) required by the autovacuum daemon, and only superusers can modify this setting."  

*(Note: While the original description doesnâ€™t specify concrete numbers, the statistics typically include metrics like row insert/update/deletion counts per table, which autovacuum uses to trigger maintenance tasks.)*
