The `vacuum_defer_cleanup_age` parameter specifies the number of transactions (default: 0) by which VACUUM and HOT updates delay cleaning up dead row versions, allowing standby queries more time to complete, though the exact grace time depends on the primary's write transaction volume.  

(Note: The sentence retains key details—default value (0), purpose (defer cleanup), and dependency on transaction volume—while being concise.)
