"The 'enable_hashjoin' knob controls the query planner's use of hash-join operations, with the default setting being 'on' (enabled)."  

*(If more detail is needed, you could add: "When enabled, hash-joins are allowed, potentially improving performance for large-table joins, while disabling it forces alternative join methods like nested loops or merge joins.")*
