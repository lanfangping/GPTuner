The `vacuum_cost_delay` parameter specifies the sleep time (in milliseconds, default 0) for a VACUUM process when the cost limit is exceeded, with recommended values typically under 1ms, though fractional delays may not be accurate on older platforms, requiring adjustments to other cost parameters instead.
