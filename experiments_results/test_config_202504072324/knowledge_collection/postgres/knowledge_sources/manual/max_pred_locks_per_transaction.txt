The `max_pred_locks_per_transaction` parameter sets the average number of object locks (e.g., tables) allocated per transaction, defaulting to 64, with the total lock capacity calculated as `max_pred_locks_per_transaction * (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions)`, limiting the number of distinct objects that can be locked concurrently across all transactions.
