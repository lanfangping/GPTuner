The `bgwriter_lru_multiplier` knob determines the number of dirty buffers written per round by multiplying the average recent buffer demand by this factor (default: 2.0), with a maximum limit set by `bgwriter_lru_maxpages`, where 1.0 writes exactly the predicted need, higher values add cushion, and lower values defer more writes to server processes.
