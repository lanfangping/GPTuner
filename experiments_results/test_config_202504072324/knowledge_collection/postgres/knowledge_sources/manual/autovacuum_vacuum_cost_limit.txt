The 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' knob sets the maximum cost limit (default -1, inheriting 'vacuum_cost_limit') for autovacuum operations, distributing the value proportionally among workers (e.g., 200 split as 100 per worker if two are active), and can be overridden per table via storage parameters.
