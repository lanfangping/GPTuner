The `effective_io_concurrency` knob sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations PostgreSQL can initiate (range: 1â€“1000, or 0 to disable), with a default of 1; for magnetic drives, a recommended starting value is the number of RAID 0/1 drives (excluding RAID 5 parity), while SSDs may benefit from values in the hundreds, though excessive values add CPU overhead.
