"The 'transaction_isolation' knob sets the current transaction's isolation level (e.g., 'read committed', 'repeatable read', 'serializable') and defaults to the value of 'default_transaction_isolation', with changes during a transaction acting like a SET TRANSACTION command."  

*(Note: While the description doesn't include specific numeric values, isolation levels are discrete states, not numerical settings.)*
