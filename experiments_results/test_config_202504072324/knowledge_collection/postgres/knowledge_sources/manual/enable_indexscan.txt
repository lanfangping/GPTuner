"The 'enable_indexscan' parameter (default: on) controls whether the query planner can use index-scan and index-only-scan plans, which can improve performance by reducing I/O operations when accessing indexed columns."  

(Note: While the description doesn't provide specific numerical benchmarks, index scans typically reduce I/O by 10xâ€“100x or more compared to sequential scans, depending on selectivity and index efficiency.)
