The `log_statement` knob controls SQL statement logging with four levels: `none` (default, logs nothing), `ddl` (logs CREATE/ALTER/DROP), `mod` (logs DDL + INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE/COPY), and `all` (logs all statements, including extended protocol executions with parameter values). Syntax errors and pre-execution failures are excluded unless `log_min_error_statement` is set to ERROR or lower.
