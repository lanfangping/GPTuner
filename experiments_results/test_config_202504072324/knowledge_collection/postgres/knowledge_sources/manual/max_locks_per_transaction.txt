The `max_locks_per_transaction` parameter defines the average number of locks (default: 64) allocated per transaction, with the total lock capacity calculated as `max_locks_per_transaction * (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions)`, and must be set equal to or higher on a standby server than on the master.
