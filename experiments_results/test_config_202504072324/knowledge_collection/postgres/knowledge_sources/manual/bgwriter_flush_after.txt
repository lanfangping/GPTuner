The `bgwriter_flush_after` knob forces the OS to write data to storage after the background writer accumulates more than 512kB (default on Linux, 0 elsewhere) of dirty data, with a valid range of 0 (disabled) to 2MB, to reduce fsync stalls and improve transaction latency, though performance may degrade for workloads between `shared_buffers` and the OS page cache size.
