The `work_mem` knob sets the base maximum memory limit (default: 4MB) for query operations like sorts or hash tables before spilling to disk, with hash-based operations potentially using more memory via `hash_mem_multiplier`, and multiple concurrent operations or sessions can collectively consume significantly more than the specified value.
