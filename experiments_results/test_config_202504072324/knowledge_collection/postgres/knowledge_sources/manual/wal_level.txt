The `wal_level` knob in PostgreSQL determines the amount of WAL data written, with three levels: **minimal** (least WAL, no row data for certain operations), **replica** (default, supports archiving and replication), and **logical** (adds logical decoding info, increasing WAL volume, especially with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` and frequent `UPDATE`/`DELETE`). Prior to 9.6, `archive` and `hot_standby` were mapped to `replica`. Minimal WAL cannot reconstruct data from backups alone.
