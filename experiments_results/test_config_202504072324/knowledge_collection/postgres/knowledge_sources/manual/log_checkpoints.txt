The 'log_checkpoints' knob logs checkpoint and restartpoint details in the server log, including statistics like the number of buffers written (e.g., 1024 buffers) and the time spent writing them (e.g., 500ms), with the default setting being off and configurable only in postgresql.conf or the server command line.
