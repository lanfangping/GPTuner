The `full_page_writes` knob, enabled by default, ensures crash recovery by writing full disk pages (typically 8KB) to WAL during their first post-checkpoint modification, preventing partial page corruption at the cost of increased WAL volume, though checkpoint interval adjustments can mitigate overhead; disabling it risks data corruption but doesnâ€™t affect PITR.
