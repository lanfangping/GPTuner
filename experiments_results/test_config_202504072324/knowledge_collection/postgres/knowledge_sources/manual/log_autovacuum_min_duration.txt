The `log_autovacuum_min_duration` parameter logs autovacuum actions that run for at least the specified time (default -1 to disable logging, 0 to log all actions, or a value like 250ms to log actions lasting 250 milliseconds or longer), and also logs skipped actions due to locks or dropped relations when enabled.
