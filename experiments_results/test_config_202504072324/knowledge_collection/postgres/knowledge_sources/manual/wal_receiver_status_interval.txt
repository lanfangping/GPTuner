The 'wal_receiver_status_interval' parameter sets the maximum interval (default: 10 seconds) at which the standby sends replication progress updates (write, flush, and apply positions) to the primary or upstream standby, with updates also triggered by position changes, and can be disabled by setting it to zero.
