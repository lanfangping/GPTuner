Understand its regular operation: it sets the maximum allowed duration of any statement, after which the statement is aborted. 3. Research if 'statement_timeout' has any special values that deviate from its regular numerical operation. 4. Discover that setting 'statement_timeout' to 0 disables the timeout feature entirely, which is a deviation from its regular numerical operation. 5. Conclude that 'statement_timeout' is a special knob due to this special value.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "0"}
