{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'max_connections'. 2. Understand its regular operation: it sets the maximum number of concurrent connections to the PostgreSQL database. 3. Determine if there are any special values that alter its behavior significantly. 4. Research or recall that 'max_connections' does not have special values like -1 or 0 that disable or significantly alter its function; it operates on a straightforward numerical basis where the value directly represents the maximum number of connections allowed. 5. Conclude that 'max_connections' is not a 'special knob' as it lacks special values that break its natural order or function.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
