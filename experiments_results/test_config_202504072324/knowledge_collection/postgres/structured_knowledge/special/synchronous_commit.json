{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'synchronous_commit' in PostgreSQL. 2. Research the functionality and possible values of 'synchronous_commit'. 3. Determine if 'synchronous_commit' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly from its normal operation. 4. Confirm that 'synchronous_commit' can be set to 'off', which is a special value that changes its behavior to not wait for the transaction to be written to disk before returning, unlike its normal operation which ensures durability by waiting. 5. Conclude that 'synchronous_commit' is a special knob due to this behavior change when set to 'off'.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "off"}
