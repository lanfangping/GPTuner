{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation: it specifies a fraction of the table size to add to autovacuum_vacuum_threshold when deciding whether to trigger a VACUUM. 3. Check if this knob has any special values that change its behavior significantly. 4. Upon research, find that setting it to 0 means that autovacuum will only consider the autovacuum_vacuum_threshold, ignoring the table size, which is a significant change in behavior. 5. Conclude that 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' is a special knob because setting it to 0 changes its behavior fundamentally.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "0"}
