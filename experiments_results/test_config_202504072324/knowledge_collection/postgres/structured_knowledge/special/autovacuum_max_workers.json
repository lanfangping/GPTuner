{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'autovacuum_max_workers'. 2. Research the function of 'autovacuum_max_workers' in PostgreSQL. 3. Determine if 'autovacuum_max_workers' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly from its regular numerical operation. 4. Based on PostgreSQL documentation, 'autovacuum_max_workers' specifies the maximum number of autovacuum processes that can run simultaneously. It does not have special values like -1 or 0 that disable or significantly alter its function; it operates on a straightforward numerical basis where the value directly corresponds to the maximum number of workers allowed. 5. Conclude that 'autovacuum_max_workers' is not a 'special knob' as it lacks special values that break its natural numerical order.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
