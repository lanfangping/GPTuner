Determine if 'log_min_duration_statement' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly from its regular numerical operation. 4. Confirm that setting 'log_min_duration_statement' to -1 disables logging of statement durations, which is a behavior distinct from its regular operation of logging statements that exceed the specified duration. 5. Conclude that 'log_min_duration_statement' is a special knob due to this special value (-1) that changes its function.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "-1"}
