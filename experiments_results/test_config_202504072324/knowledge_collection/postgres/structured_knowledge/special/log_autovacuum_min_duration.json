{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'log_autovacuum_min_duration' in PostgreSQL. 2. Research its functionality and possible values. 3. Determine if it has any special values that deviate from its numerical ordering to perform a distinct function. 4. Confirm if setting it to a specific value like -1 or 0 changes its behavior significantly, such as disabling logging for autovacuum operations. 5. Based on the findings, classify the knob as 'special' or not.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
