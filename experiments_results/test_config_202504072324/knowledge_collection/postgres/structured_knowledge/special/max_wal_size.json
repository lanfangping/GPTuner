{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'max_wal_size'. 2. Research the function of 'max_wal_size' in PostgreSQL to understand its regular operation. 3. Determine if 'max_wal_size' has any special values that alter its function significantly from its regular operation. 4. Based on PostgreSQL documentation, 'max_wal_size' does not have special values like -1 or 0 that disable or significantly alter its function; it operates within a defined numerical range to control the maximum size of WAL files. 5. Conclude that 'max_wal_size' is not a 'special knob' as it lacks special values that break its natural order or function.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
