Recognize that setting 'enable_indexscan' to 'off' (or 'false') disables index scans, which is a different behavior from its regular operation of enabling index scans when set to 'on' (or 'true'). 4. Conclude that 'enable_indexscan' can be considered a 'special knob' because it has a special value ('off') that changes its behavior significantly.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
