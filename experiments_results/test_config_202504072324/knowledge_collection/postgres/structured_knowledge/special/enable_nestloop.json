{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'enable_nestloop' in PostgreSQL. 2. Research the function of 'enable_nestloop' to understand its regular operation. 3. Determine if 'enable_nestloop' has any special values that alter its function significantly. 4. Confirm that setting 'enable_nestloop' to 'off' (which can be considered as a special value like 0 or false) disables nested loop joins, changing its behavior from the regular operation. 5. Conclude that 'enable_nestloop' is a special knob because it has a special value ('off') that changes its function.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "off"}
