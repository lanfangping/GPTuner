Understand the typical behavior of 'transaction_isolation' in PostgreSQL, which sets the isolation level for transactions. 3. Determine if 'transaction_isolation' has any special values that deviate from its standard numerical or ordered behavior. 4. Research PostgreSQL documentation to confirm if 'transaction_isolation' accepts special values like -1 or 0 that disable or significantly alter its function. 5. Conclude based on findings whether 'transaction_isolation' is a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
