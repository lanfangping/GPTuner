{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'max_worker_processes' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation, which is to set the maximum number of background worker processes that the system can support. 3. Research if 'max_worker_processes' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly from its regular operation. 4. Discover that setting 'max_worker_processes' to 0 effectively disables the background worker processes, which is a significant deviation from its regular operation. 5. Conclude that 'max_worker_processes' is a special knob due to this behavior.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "0"}
