{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'enable_seqscan' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation: it enables or disables the planner's use of sequential scan plan types. 3. Recognize that setting 'enable_seqscan' to 'off' (or 'false') disables sequential scans, which is a significant deviation from its regular operation where it enables them. 4. Conclude that 'enable_seqscan' can be considered a 'special knob' because setting it to 'off' changes its behavior fundamentally.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
