I first give you a knob of postgres and its tuning suggestion, please judge whether the tuning suggestion is related to the given hardware sources.Note that a knob may be related to more than one class.

KNOB:
autovacuum_vacuum_threshold
TUNING_SUGGESTION:


Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format. If the suggestion is related to the resource, put true as the value. If not, return false.
