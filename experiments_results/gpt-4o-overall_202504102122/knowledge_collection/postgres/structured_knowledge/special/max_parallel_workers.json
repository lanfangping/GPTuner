{"think_procedure": "First, identify if the knob 'max_parallel_workers' has any special values that change its behavior significantly. Check PostgreSQL documentation or resources to see if setting this knob to certain values like -1, 0, or any other specific number alters its operation beyond adjusting the number of parallel workers. For many PostgreSQL knobs, setting a value to 0 or -1 can disable a feature or set it to an automatic mode. Verify if 'max_parallel_workers' has such a special value. If there is a special value, classify it as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
