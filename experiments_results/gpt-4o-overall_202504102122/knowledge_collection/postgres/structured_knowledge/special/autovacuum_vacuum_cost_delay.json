{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' in PostgreSQL is used to set the delay in milliseconds between each vacuum operation to prevent the vacuum process from consuming too many resources. Normally, this knob would be set to a positive integer representing the delay time. However, if a special value such as -1 or 0 is used, it might indicate a special function, like disabling the delay or the feature entirely. Checking the PostgreSQL documentation for this specific knob, it is found that setting it to 0 disables the autovacuum cost delay, which is a special behavior compared to its regular operation as a numerical knob. Therefore, 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' is classified as a special knob due to its behavior when set to 0.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
