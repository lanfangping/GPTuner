{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'cpu_tuple_cost' is a special knob, I need to understand its function and behavior. The 'cpu_tuple_cost' knob in PostgreSQL is used to set the cost of processing each tuple (row) during query execution. Typically, this is a positive numerical value representing the estimated cost of CPU processing per tuple. A special knob would have a specific value that significantly alters its behavior, such as disabling a feature or activating a different mode. Common special values for knobs include -1 or 0, which often indicate disabling a feature or setting a default behavior. I will check the PostgreSQL documentation or reliable sources to see if 'cpu_tuple_cost' has any such special values. If it has a special value that changes its behavior drastically, it would be classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
