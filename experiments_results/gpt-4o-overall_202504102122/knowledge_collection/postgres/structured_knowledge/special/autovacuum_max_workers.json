{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the role of the knob 'autovacuum_max_workers' in PostgreSQL. It controls the maximum number of autovacuum processes that can run simultaneously. 2. Determine if there are any special values for this knob that change its behavior significantly from its numerical order. 3. Check the PostgreSQL documentation for any mention of special values like -1 or 0. 4. Verify if setting the knob to 0 or any other specific value disables the feature or alters its operation in a way that is distinct from its numerical progression.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
