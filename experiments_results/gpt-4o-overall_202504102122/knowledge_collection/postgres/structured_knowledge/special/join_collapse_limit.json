{"think_procedure": "First, identify the purpose and behavior of the 'join_collapse_limit' knob in PostgreSQL. The 'join_collapse_limit' knob controls the maximum number of tables that the query planner will join in one go without considering alternative join orders. Next, determine if there are any special values that alter its behavior significantly compared to its regular numerical function. In PostgreSQL, setting 'join_collapse_limit' to 1 effectively disables join reordering, which is a distinct behavior compared to other numerical values where the planner would reorder joins up to the specified limit. Therefore, -1 or 0 are not special values, but 1 is a special value that changes the functionality of the knob. Finally, conclude that 'join_collapse_limit' is a special knob because of this distinct behavior with the value 1.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 1}
