{"think_procedure": "The 'parallel_tuple_cost' knob in PostgreSQL is used to set the cost of processing each tuple (row) during parallel query execution. To determine if it is a 'special knob', we need to check if it has any special values like -1 or 0 that alter its behavior fundamentally, such as disabling the feature entirely. Typically, 'parallel_tuple_cost' is set to a positive numeric value to influence the cost estimation for parallel queries. There is no documentation indicating that it has special values like -1 or 0 that change its function, such as disabling parallel processing. Therefore, it behaves as a regular numerical knob with no special values that alter its fundamental operation.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
