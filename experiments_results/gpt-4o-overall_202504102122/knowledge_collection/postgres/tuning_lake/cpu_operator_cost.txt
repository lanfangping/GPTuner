{'suggestion': "To configure the 'cpu_operator_cost' knob in PostgreSQL, understand that it determines the planner's cost estimate for processing each operator or function in a query, with a default value of 0.0025. It is recommended to begin with this default setting and adjust it based on your system's performance and workload characteristics. Testing with your specific query patterns and hardware setup can guide you in fine-tuning this parameter. If your system is highly CPU-efficient, consider decreasing the value slightly, while for systems with lower CPU efficiency, a slight increase may optimize query planning."}
