{'suggestion': "To configure the 'statement_timeout' setting in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to assign a time limit in milliseconds that specifies the maximum duration a query can run before being automatically terminated. This setting is measured from the time the server receives the command. While the default is zero milliseconds (disabled), it is advisable to avoid setting this parameter in the postgresql.conf file as it affects all sessions. Instead, consider setting it for individual sessions using a command like `SET statement_timeout TO '10000';` to limit queries to 10 seconds."}
