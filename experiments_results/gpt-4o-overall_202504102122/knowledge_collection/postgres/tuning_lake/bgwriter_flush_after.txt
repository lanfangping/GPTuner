{'suggestion': "The 'bgwriter_flush_after' setting in PostgreSQL should be configured to manage the kernel's page cache effectively by forcing the OS to flush writes to storage after a specific amount of data has been written by the background writer. On Linux systems, this is typically set after writing 512kB of data. Adjustments should be made based on your system's requirements and I/O capacity to ensure optimal performance without causing I/O contention."}
