{'suggestion': "To configure PostgreSQL's 'max_connections' setting effectively, determine the maximum number of concurrent connections your application requires, typically starting with the default of 100 connections. This setting must be configured at server start, and standby servers should have an equal or greater value than the master to allow queries. For optimal performance, consider using connection pooling. In transaction mode, set 'max_connections' as a low multiple (2-5x) of the number of server cores. If using session mode, set it to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued. Ensure your server's CPU and RAM resources can handle the increased workload, generally allowing approximately 10-20 MB of RAM per connection."}
