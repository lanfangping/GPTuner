{'suggestion': "To optimize the performance of maintenance operations like VACUUM and CREATE INDEX in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to set the `maintenance_work_mem` to a higher value than the default 64MB, considering the system's RAM capacity. This setting determines the maximum memory used for these operations, and raising it can enhance speed, especially with large RAM resources and write-heavy operations. However, be mindful that autovacuum may allocate memory up to the `autovacuum_max_workers` times this amount, and VACUUM's memory use for dead tuple identifiers is capped at 1GB. Ensure the total memory allocation does not exceed system limits to avoid swapping."}
