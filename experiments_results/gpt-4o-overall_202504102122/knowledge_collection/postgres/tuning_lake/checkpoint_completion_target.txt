{'suggestion': "To configure the 'checkpoint_completion_target' parameter in PostgreSQL, which dictates the fraction of time between checkpoints for completion, update the postgresql.conf file or use the server command line. Start with a value around 0.7 for typical workloads to balance checkpoint spreading over the entire interval and minimize I/O spikes. For development instances, consider setting it to 0.9 to smooth I/O activity over larger periods. If using this value for non-streaming replicas, maintain a low percentage to ensure optimal performance."}
