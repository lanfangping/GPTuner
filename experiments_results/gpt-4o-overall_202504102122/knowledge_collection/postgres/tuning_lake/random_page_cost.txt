{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'random_page_cost' parameter in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 4.0, which estimates the cost of accessing non-sequential disk pages. This parameter can be adjusted to influence the database's preference for index scans over sequential scans. In environments with high cache usage or when using solid-state drives (SSDs), consider reducing the value to around 1.0-2.0 to better reflect the lower cost of random disk access. This adjustment assumes that approximately 90% of random reads are cached, making it beneficial in highly-cached environments or when using disk technology with a random access profile similar to SSDs."}
