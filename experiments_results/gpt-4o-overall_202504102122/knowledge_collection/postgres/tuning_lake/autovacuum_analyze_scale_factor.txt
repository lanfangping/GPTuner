{'suggestion': "To configure 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, set it in the 'postgresql.conf' file or via the server command line, with possible table-level overrides. The default value is 0.1, which triggers an ANALYZE operation when 10% of the table's data changes. Adjust this value based on your database's activity and performance needs. For high-transaction tables, consider reducing it to around 0.05 to increase the frequency of statistics updates. This adjustment helps optimize performance by ensuring timely updates, whereas for tables with infrequent updates, you might increase it to 0.2."}
