{'suggestion': "To optimize parallel maintenance operations in Postgres, configure the `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` parameter to manage the number of parallel workers used by utility commands such as `CREATE INDEX` and non-FULL `VACUUM`. The default setting is 2 workers, but this can be adjusted based on your system's CPU capacity, typically ranging from one-fourth to one-half of the total CPU cores, without exceeding 8 workers. Note that setting it to 0 will disable parallelism. While the total memory usage for these operations is governed by `maintenance_work_mem`, be mindful that CPU and I/O usage may still increase with higher worker counts."}
