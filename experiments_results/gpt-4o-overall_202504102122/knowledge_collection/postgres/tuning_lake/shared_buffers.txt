{'suggestion': "For optimal performance of PostgreSQL, configure the 'shared_buffers' setting to approximately 25% of the total system RAM, ensuring it does not exceed 40% of RAM. This is particularly applicable for dedicated database servers with at least 1GB of RAM. It's crucial to consider that larger buffer allocations may require an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Additionally, for systems with hundreds of GBs of RAM, the use of huge pages might be beneficial. Conduct your own benchmarks to fine-tune this setting, especially on non-dedicated servers, as each PostgreSQL instance will require its own memory allocation. Also, ensure that the OS kernel parameters 'shmmax' and 'shmall' are configured to support the set buffer size."}
