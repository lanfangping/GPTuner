{'suggestion': "To configure 'autovacuum_max_workers' in PostgreSQL, set this parameter at server start to specify the maximum number of autovacuum processes, excluding the launcher, that can run simultaneously. The default is three, but it should be adjusted based on system resources and workload demands. A good starting point is to set it to a value equivalent to the number of CPU cores divided by 2, ensuring it does not exceed available resources. Typically, this value ranges from 2 to 10 for balanced systems. Additionally, consider the impact on I/O activity and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind that for development instances, a lower value is often used."}
