{'suggestion': "The 'checkpoint_flush_after' parameter in PostgreSQL should be configured to define the threshold of data written during a checkpoint that triggers the operating system to flush these writes. This helps in reducing transaction latency but may impact performance depending on the workload size in relation to the cache size. It is important to set a value that optimizes checkpoint writes without overloading the cache. This parameter can only be configured in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line."}
