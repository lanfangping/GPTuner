{'suggestion': "For the PostgreSQL knob 'full_page_writes', it is recommended to keep it enabled by default to ensure data integrity by writing the entire disk page to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) after the first modification following each checkpoint. While disabling it can speed up operations, it poses a risk of data corruption similar to turning off 'fsync'. Therefore, it should only be considered if you have reliable power failure protection and are willing to accept the potential risks."}
