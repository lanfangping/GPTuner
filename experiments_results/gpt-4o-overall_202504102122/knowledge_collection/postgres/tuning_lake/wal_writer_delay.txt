{'suggestion': "To configure the 'wal_writer_delay' parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to determine the frequency of WAL writer flushes, starting with the default value of 200 milliseconds. Ensure that the value is a multiple of 10 milliseconds due to system sleep resolution. Adjustments should be made in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line, taking into consideration the desired balance between write latency and system resource usage, and tuning it according to your specific workload requirements and performance observations."}
