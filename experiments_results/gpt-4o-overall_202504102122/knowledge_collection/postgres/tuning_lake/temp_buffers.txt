{'suggestion': "The 'temp_buffers' knob in PostgreSQL sets the maximum memory allocated for temporary buffers per database session, primarily used for temporary table access. The default setting is 8MB, assuming a block size of 8kB. To optimize performance, especially during complex queries or large data sorting operations, it is advisable to adjust this setting within the limits of your system's available resources. Any changes should be made prior to using temporary tables in a session to ensure efficiency."}
