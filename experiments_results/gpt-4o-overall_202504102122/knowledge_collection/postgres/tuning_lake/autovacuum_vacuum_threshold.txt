{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' in PostgreSQL, it specifies that a VACUUM operation is triggered when a table reaches a certain number of updated or deleted tuples. This setting can be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file, on the server command line, or via individual table storage parameters. While a common baseline value is 50, it should be fine-tuned based on your specific workload and update frequency to optimize database performance."}
