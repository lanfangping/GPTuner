{'suggestion': "The 'enable_seqscan' knob in PostgreSQL is a boolean setting that defaults to 'on'. It allows you to discourage the query planner from using sequential scan plans, but it cannot completely eliminate their use if no alternative plans are available. This setting can be useful for testing query plans or specific optimization scenarios."}
