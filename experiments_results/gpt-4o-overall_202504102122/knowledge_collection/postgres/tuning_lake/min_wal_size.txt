{'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance, configure the 'min_wal_size' parameter by setting it in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. The default value is 80 MB, which is low, so it should be increased unless disk space is a constraint. This setting ensures that old WAL files are recycled rather than removed, maintaining efficient disk usage. Ensure that 'min_wal_size' is less than 'max_wal_size', which should be at least twice the 'min_wal_size' for optimal performance, while considering your system's workload and available disk space."}
