{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'max_parallel_workers' setting in PostgreSQL, adjust it in conjunction with related parameters such as 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers' and 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather.' Ensure this setting aligns with 'max_worker_processes' to enhance performance. Start by setting 'max_parallel_workers' to a value that is half or slightly more than the available CPU cores, such as 4 on an 8-core system. Adjust further based on workload testing and performance needs."}
