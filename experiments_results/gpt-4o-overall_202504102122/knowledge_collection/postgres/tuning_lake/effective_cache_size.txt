{'suggestion': "To configure the 'effective_cache_size' in PostgreSQL, consider both PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel disk cache, especially for concurrent queries on different tables. This setting influences the planner's assumptions about available disk cache size for query estimation, affecting whether index or sequential scans are favored. A common approach is to set it to approximately the system RAM minus the sum of (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) multiplied by 1.1, or a lower value if the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL. This configuration does not impact the actual amount of physical RAM used by queries."}
