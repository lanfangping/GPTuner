{'comprehensive_suggestion': "Ensure the 'autovacuum' feature in PostgreSQL is enabled by default to activate the autovacuum launcher daemon, which is essential for maintaining database performance by removing dead tuples and updating table statistics. This requires 'track_counts' to be active and can only be configured in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. For fine-tuning, adjust parameters such as 'autovacuum_max_workers' and 'autovacuum_naptime' according to workload and system resources. While individual table autovacuuming can be disabled by modifying table storage parameters, ensure necessary processes remain active to prevent transaction ID wraparound."}
