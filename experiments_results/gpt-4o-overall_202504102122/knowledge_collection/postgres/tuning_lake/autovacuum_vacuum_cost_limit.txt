{'suggestion': "To optimize the performance of autovacuum operations in PostgreSQL, configure the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' by setting it in the postgresql.conf file or the server command line. The default value is -1, which uses the regular vacuum_cost_limit. Consider increasing this value to 1,000 or more to allow autovacuum to operate more aggressively, especially in larger databases, while ensuring that the total cost limit is distributed among autovacuum workers without exceeding the set limit. This adjustment can enhance autovacuum efficiency without negatively impacting system performance, provided the system's I/O capacity can accommodate the additional load."}
