{'suggestion': "To set the 'transaction_isolation' knob in PostgreSQL, use the SQL command `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` followed by the desired level. The isolation level for the current transaction initially matches 'default_transaction_isolation' at the start of the transaction. To change this, you must use the `SET TRANSACTION` command. Options for the isolation level include `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, or `SERIALIZABLE`. Among these, `READ COMMITTED` is the default level, providing a balance between performance and consistency for most transactions."}
