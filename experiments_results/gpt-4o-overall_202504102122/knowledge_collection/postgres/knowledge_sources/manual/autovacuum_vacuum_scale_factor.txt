The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' determines the fraction of a table's size, defaulting to 0.2 (or 20%), that is added to the autovacuum_vacuum_threshold to decide if a VACUUM operation should be triggered, and is set in the postgresql.conf file or server command line, with table-specific overriding possible via table storage parameters.
