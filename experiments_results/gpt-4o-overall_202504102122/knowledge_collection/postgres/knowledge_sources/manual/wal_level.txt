The "wal_level" parameter, set at server start, controls the amount of data written to the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL), with "minimal" producing the least volume by excluding row information for permanent relations, "replica" as the default supporting WAL archiving and replication, and "logical" adding extra details for logical decoding, noting that "logical" increases WAL volume significantly for tables with "REPLICA IDENTITY FULL" during numerous UPDATE and DELETE operations; earlier values like "archive" and "hot_standby" are now equivalent to "replica".
