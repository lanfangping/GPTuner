The knob 'log_min_duration_statement' logs the duration of each completed SQL statement if it runs for at least a specified minimum time, such as 250 milliseconds, with a default setting of -1 to disable logging, and allows only superusers to change it, while also overriding sampling settings to always log queries exceeding the specified duration.
