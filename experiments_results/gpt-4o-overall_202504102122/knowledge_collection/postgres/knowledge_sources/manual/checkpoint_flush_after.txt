The 'checkpoint_flush_after' parameter defines the threshold of data written during a checkpoint (defaulting to 256kB on Linux or 0 elsewhere) that triggers the OS to flush these writes, with a valid range from 0 to 2MB, helping reduce transaction latency but potentially affecting performance based on workload size compared to cache, and it can only be configured in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line.
