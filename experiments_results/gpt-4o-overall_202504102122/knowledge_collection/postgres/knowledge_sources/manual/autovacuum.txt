The 'autovacuum' knob controls the activation of the autovacuum launcher daemon, is enabled by default, but requires 'track_counts' to be active and can only be configured in the postgresql.conf file or server command line, with individual table autovacuuming disabled by modifying table storage parameters, while still allowing necessary processes to prevent transaction ID wraparound.
