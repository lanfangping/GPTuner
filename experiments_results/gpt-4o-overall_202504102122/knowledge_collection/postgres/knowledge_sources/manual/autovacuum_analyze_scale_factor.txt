The `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` specifies a fraction (default 0.1 or 10% of the table size) to be added to the `autovacuum_analyze_threshold` to determine when to trigger an ANALYZE, and it can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or server command line, with possible overrides at the table level.
