The 'shared_buffers' setting determines the memory allocated for shared memory buffers in the database server, with a default value of 128MB, and should ideally be set to 25% of system memory on dedicated database servers with 1GB or more RAM, not exceeding 40% of RAM to ensure effective performance, with larger values necessitating an increase in max_wal_size.
