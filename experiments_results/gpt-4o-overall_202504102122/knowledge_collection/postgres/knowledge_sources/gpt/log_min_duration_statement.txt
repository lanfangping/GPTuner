To set the value for the 'log_min_duration_statement' knob in PostgreSQL, you should choose a threshold, in milliseconds, above which the execution duration of SQL statements will be logged; for example, setting it to 1000 will log all statements that take longer than one second to execute, whereas setting it to -1 will disable logging of statement durations entirely.
