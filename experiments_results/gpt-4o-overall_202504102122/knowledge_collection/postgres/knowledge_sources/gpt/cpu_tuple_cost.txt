The 'cpu_tuple_cost' knob in PostgreSQL should typically be set to reflect the estimated cost of processing each tuple (row), with a common starting value being 0.01, which is intended to represent the cost of CPU usage for executing simple operations on a tuple; you may adjust this value based on empirical testing and workload characteristics to optimize performance.
