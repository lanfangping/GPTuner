To set the 'effective_cache_size' in PostgreSQL, a common recommendation is to configure it to approximately 50% to 75% of the server's total RAM, providing a guideline that often translates to around 4GB on an 8GB RAM system as a starting point, thereby helping the query planner estimate how much memory is available for caching data.
