To set the value of 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' in PostgreSQL, you should start by determining the appropriate delay based on your system's workload, typically beginning with the default setting of 20 milliseconds and adjusting upward in increments of 5-10 milliseconds if you notice autovacuum processes impacting system performance, while keeping in mind that higher values mean less frequent autovacuum activity but could lead to increased table bloat.
