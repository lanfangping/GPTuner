To set the value for the 'enable_hashjoin' knob in PostgreSQL, you can adjust it within the configuration file (postgresql.conf) by setting it to 'on' to enable hash joins, or 'off' to disable them, noting that the default is typically 'on', reflecting PostgreSQLâ€™s preference for hash joins when they are the most efficient plan, and you can use the command `SET enable_hashjoin = off;` to temporarily disable it in a session.
