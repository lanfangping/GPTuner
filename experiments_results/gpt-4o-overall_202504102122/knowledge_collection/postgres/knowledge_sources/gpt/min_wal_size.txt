To set the value for 'min_wal_size' in PostgreSQL, you should consider the workload and disk space, typically starting with at least 1 GB and adjusting upwards depending on your system's write activity and available disk space, ensuring it's less than 'max_wal_size' which should be at least twice the 'min_wal_size' for optimal performance.
