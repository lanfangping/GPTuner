To set the value for PostgreSQL's 'max_connections', begin by determining the number of concurrent connections your application requires, considering that PostgreSQL's default is 100 connections; however, ensure your server's resources, such as CPU and RAM, can support the increased workload if you raise this limit, generally using a rule of thumb of allowing approximately 10-20 MB of RAM per connection.
