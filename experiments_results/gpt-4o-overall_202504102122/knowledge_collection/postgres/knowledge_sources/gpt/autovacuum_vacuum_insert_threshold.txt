To set the value for the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' knob in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 1,000 inserted tuples and adjust based on your system's workload, increasing it for write-heavy environments to reduce autovacuum frequency or decreasing it if timely vacuuming of insert-only tables is critical for performance.
