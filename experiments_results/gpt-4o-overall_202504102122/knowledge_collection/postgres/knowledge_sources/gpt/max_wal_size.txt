To set the value for the 'max_wal_size' knob in PostgreSQL, you typically begin with a default value such as 1GB, and then adjust it based on your workload; for example, increasing it to 4GB to 16GB can help accommodate larger transaction volumes and reduce the frequency of checkpoints, thereby improving performance.
