To set the value for the 'temp_buffers' knob in PostgreSQL, it is generally recommended to allocate between 8MB and 16MB, as this determines the amount of memory dedicated for temporary tables created by each session, and adjusting this within your system's available resources can improve performance during complex queries or large data sorting operations.
