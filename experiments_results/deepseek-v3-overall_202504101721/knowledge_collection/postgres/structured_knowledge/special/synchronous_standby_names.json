Understand its regular operation, which involves specifying a list of standby servers that can take over if the primary server fails. 3. Recognize that setting this knob to an empty string ('') or a special keyword like 'ANY' changes its behavior significantly, such as allowing any standby to take over or disabling synchronous replication, respectively. 4. Conclude that since these special values alter the knob's behavior fundamentally, it qualifies as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "'' (empty string) or 'ANY'"}
