{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'max_connections' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation, which is to set the maximum number of concurrent connections to the database. 3. Research if 'max_connections' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly from its regular operation. 4. Determine if setting 'max_connections' to a specific value (like -1 or 0) disables the feature or changes its behavior in a way that doesn't follow the natural order of numerical values. 5. Conclude whether 'max_connections' is a 'special knob' based on the findings.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
