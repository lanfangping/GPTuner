{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'To configure `max_worker_processes` in PostgreSQL, set it to the maximum number of background processes the system can support, with a default value of 8. This setting should be aligned with standby servers and coordinated with parallel worker settings, including `max_parallel_workers`, `max_parallel_maintenance_workers`, and `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`. While the allocation can consider the number of CPU cores for baseline calculation, the primary focus should be on system-wide support for background processes and parallel operations, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance across all related settings.'}
