{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_analyze_threshold` parameter determines the minimum number of inserted, updated, or deleted tuples (default: 50) needed to trigger an automatic `ANALYZE` operation on a table. This threshold can be adjusted based on table activity: use the default **50** for small tables, increase to **100â€“500** for moderately active tables, or set higher (e.g., **1000+**) for large, heavily updated tables to reduce analyze frequency while maintaining stats accuracy. Additionally, this threshold can be overridden for individual tables via storage parameters.'}
