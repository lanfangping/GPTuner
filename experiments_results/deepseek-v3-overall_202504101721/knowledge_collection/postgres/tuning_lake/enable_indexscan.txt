{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_indexscan' parameter in PostgreSQL, which is set to 'on' by default, allows the query planner to utilize index-scan and index-only-scan operations for potentially improved performance by accessing data through indexes. While it's generally recommended to keep this setting enabled for optimal query performance, there may be specific scenarios, such as when retrieving a large portion of a table's rows (commonly over 30%, though this can vary based on data distribution, index selectivity, and hardware) or dealing with very small tables, where disabling it (using `SET enable_indexscan TO off;` in a session or adjusting `postgresql.conf` globally) to allow sequential scans could be more efficient. It's advisable to benchmark the performance impact of this setting on specific queries using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to make an informed decision."}
