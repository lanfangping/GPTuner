{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `full_page_writes` knob in PostgreSQL is enabled by default to ensure crash recovery by writing full disk pages to WAL after a checkpoint, which prevents partial-page corruption but increases WAL volume by up to 2-3x. Disabling it can improve performance, similar to tuning `fsync`, but risks data loss. It is recommended to disable it (`off`) only if you have a battery-backed RAID controller or a similar crash-safe filesystem to improve write performance (~20-30% faster writes), otherwise, leave it enabled (`on`) to prevent partial-page writes after crashes, especially on systems with unsafe storage. Always verify durability requirements before making changes.'}
