{'suggestion': {'description': "To set the 'hot_standby' knob in PostgreSQL, enable it ('on') for standby servers to allow read-only queries during recovery. This parameter is a boolean ('on'/'off') and can only be configured at server startup. It defaults to 'on', enabling query execution during recovery (archive recovery or standby mode). For optimal performance, consider adjusting 'max_standby_archive_delay' and 'max_standby_streaming_delay' based on your workload's tolerance for replication lag, though specific delay values should be determined according to your system's requirements.", 'note': "The 'hot_standby' parameter is crucial for allowing read-only queries on standby servers during recovery. Ensure to configure it at server startup as it cannot be changed on the fly. The exact delay values for 'max_standby_archive_delay' and 'max_standby_streaming_delay' should be tailored to balance between query availability and replication consistency according to your specific workload needs."}}
