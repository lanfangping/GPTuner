{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'bgwriter_lru_maxpages' parameter controls the number of buffers the background writer can write per round, with a default setting of 100. This setting does not affect checkpoints. For optimal performance, consider adjusting this value based on your system's workload: start with a range of 100–1000 pages per cycle. Lower values (100–200) are recommended for systems with conservative I/O or smaller setups, while higher values (500–1000) may be beneficial for write-heavy workloads. However, ensure that the adjusted value does not exceed 25% of 'shared_buffers' (adjusted by 'bgwriter_lru_multiplier') to avoid contention. Monitoring 'buffers_backend' versus 'buffers_alloc' in 'pg_stat_bgwriter' can help determine if adjustments are needed; if backend writes are high, consider incrementally increasing 'bgwriter_lru_maxpages' by 100."}
