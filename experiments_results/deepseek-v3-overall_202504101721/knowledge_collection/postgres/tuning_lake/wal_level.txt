{'suggestion': "The `wal_level` knob in PostgreSQL determines the detail of WAL logging with three levels: `minimal` (least data, no row info for certain operations, cannot reconstruct data from backups alone), `replica` (default, supports archiving and replication), and `logical` (adds logical decoding info, increasing WAL volume, especially with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` and frequent UPDATE/DELETE operations). Prior to PostgreSQL 9.6, `archive` and `hot_standby` were valid values but now map to `replica`. Choose the level based on your needs: `minimal` for no replication, `replica` for physical replication and logical decoding, or `logical` for logical replication and decoding. For example, use `replica` for streaming replication with the command `ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'replica';`."}
