{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimize the `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` setting in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to consider the default value of 2 workers, understanding that each additional worker consumes resources similarly to an additional session, potentially increasing CPU, memory, and I/O usage significantly (e.g., 4 workers may use 5x more resources than a non-parallel query). While a general guideline suggests configuring 2–4 workers per CPU core (e.g., 4–16 workers on a 4-core system), it's crucial to ensure that the total number of workers (`max_worker_processes`) accommodates other parallel operations. Begin with a conservative number of workers (e.g., 2–4) and incrementally adjust based on workload performance to avoid diminishing returns."}
