{'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance and balance I/O load during checkpoints, set the 'checkpoint_completion_target' to 50% (default 0.5) of the interval between checkpoints. This approach aims to ensure that checkpoints complete halfway through the interval, balancing I/O load and performance effectively. While other suggestions propose setting it between 70-90% for smoother I/O, the manual suggestion takes precedence, recommending the default value of 0.5 for optimal balance."}
