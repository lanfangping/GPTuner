{'suggestion': "To configure the 'transaction_isolation' in PostgreSQL, you can set it at the start of each transaction, inheriting from 'default_transaction_isolation'. The isolation level cannot be changed mid-transaction without using a `SET TRANSACTION` command. For setting the isolation level, you can choose among 'read uncommitted' (rarely used), 'read committed' (default, offering a balance between consistency and performance), 'repeatable read' (prevents non-repeatable reads), or 'serializable' (the strictest level, ensuring full isolation but potentially reducing concurrency). Use `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL <value>;` for a session-specific setting or `ALTER DATABASE ... SET default_transaction_isolation = '<value>';` to set a database-wide default."}
