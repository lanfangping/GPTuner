{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age` parameter should be set to a value between **100 million (100,000,000)** and **200 million (200,000,000)**, based on your transaction volume, to prevent transaction ID wraparound while balancing autovacuum frequency. This value must be lower than `vacuum_multixact_freeze_table_age` (default: 150 million). The default setting is **400 million multixacts**, which serves as the maximum age a table's `relminmxid` can reach before forcing a VACUUM to prevent multixact ID wraparound and enables cleanup of old `pg_multixact` files. Adjust the value lower for high-write systems to avoid bloat or higher for read-heavy workloads to reduce maintenance overhead."}
