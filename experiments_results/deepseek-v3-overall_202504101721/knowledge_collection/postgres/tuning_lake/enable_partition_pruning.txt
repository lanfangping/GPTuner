{'suggestion': "The 'enable_partition_pruning' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's ability to exclude irrelevant partitions from query plans, thereby improving performance by reducing the amount of data scanned. It is enabled by default (on) in PostgreSQL 11 and later versions, as detailed in Section 5.11.4. While it is recommended to keep it enabled for most workloads to achieve significant query performance improvements on partitioned tables (typically yielding 2-10x speedups), it should be disabled (off or false) only for debugging purposes or in edge cases where partition pruning might lead to incorrect results."}
