{'suggestion': "The 'enable_hashagg' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of hashed aggregation plans, with the default setting being on (enabled). It is recommended to enable it for large aggregations (e.g., >10,000 rows) to leverage hash-based performance gains, or disable it for small datasets (e.g., <1,000 rows) to avoid overhead. Adjustments should be made based on query plans and memory constraints."}
