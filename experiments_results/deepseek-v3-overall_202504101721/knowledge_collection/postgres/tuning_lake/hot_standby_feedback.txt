{'suggestion': 'To manage the `hot_standby_feedback` parameter in PostgreSQL effectively, enable it (`on`) to allow standby servers to send feedback to the primary server about query cancellations, which helps in reducing replication conflicts. This feedback is sent every `wal_receiver_status_interval` (default: 10 seconds). However, be aware that enabling this feature may lead to primary database bloat, particularly if the `old_snapshot_threshold` is exceeded (default: -1, disabled). It is recommended to leave it disabled (`off`) if no replication conflicts are observed to avoid unnecessary bloat.'}
