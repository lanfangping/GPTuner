{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `wal_buffers` knob in PostgreSQL controls the amount of shared memory for unwritten WAL data. It defaults to 1/32nd of `shared_buffers`, with a floor of 32kB if manually set lower, and values without units are treated as 8kB blocks. A common recommendation is to allocate 4MB (default) or 1/32 of `shared_buffers`, whichever is larger, with adjustments based on write-heavy workloads (e.g., up to 64MB for high WAL activity). For example, if `shared_buffers` is 8GB, 1/32 would be 256MB, but it's advisable to cap at 16MB unless high WAL throughput justifies more. Setting it to a few MB can improve write performance under high commit loads."}
