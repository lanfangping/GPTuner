{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure the `statement_timeout` in PostgreSQL, first understand that this setting aborts any statement that exceeds the specified duration, with the default being 0 (disabled). It's measured from command arrival to completion, applying individual timeouts per statement in simple-Query messages (note: pre-13 PostgreSQL applied it to the entire query string). Avoid setting it in postgresql.conf to prevent session-wide impact. For setting the timeout, determine an appropriate value based on your workload (e.g., 30s for interactive queries, 5-10min for batch jobs, or 0 to disable), then configure it via `SET statement_timeout = '30s'` for session-level adjustments or `ALTER SYSTEM SET statement_timeout = '5min'` for server-wide changes. Adjust the values to fit your specific needs, such as `'2h'` for long-running reports or `'1s'` for strict latency control."}
