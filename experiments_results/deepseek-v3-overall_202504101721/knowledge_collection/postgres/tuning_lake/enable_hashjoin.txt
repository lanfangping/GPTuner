{'suggestion': "The 'enable_hashjoin' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of hash-join operations, with the default setting being 'on' (enabled). It is recommended to enable it ('on' or 'true') for queries involving large tables where hash joins are efficient, such as when joining tables with 10,000+ rows. Conversely, disable it ('off' or 'false') to force nested loop or merge joins if hash joins perform poorly, especially for small tables under 1,000 rows or with low cardinality. Adjustments should be based on query plan analysis and benchmarking."}
