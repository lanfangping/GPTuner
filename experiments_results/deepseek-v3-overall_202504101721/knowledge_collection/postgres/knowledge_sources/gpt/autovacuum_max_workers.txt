To set `autovacuum_max_workers`, allocate **1 worker per CPU core (up to 3-5 workers)** for typical systems, but avoid exceeding **half of available CPU cores** or **system memory limits** (e.g., each worker needs ~100MB–1GB RAM). Adjust higher (e.g., **5–8 workers**) for heavy-write workloads or many tables, but ensure total workers × `autovacuum_work_mem` does not exhaust memory. Default is **3**.
