To set the `autovacuum` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (typically `on` by default) and adjust related parameters like `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` (default 0.2) and `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` (default 50) to balance between aggressive cleanup (e.g., lower scale factor to 0.05 for high-churn tables) and performance, while monitoring table statistics (e.g., `pg_stat_user_tables.n_dead_tup`) to fine-tune thresholds.
