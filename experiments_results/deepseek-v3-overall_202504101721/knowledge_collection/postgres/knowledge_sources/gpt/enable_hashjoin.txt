To set the `enable_hashjoin` knob in PostgreSQL, typically enable it (`on` or `true`) for queries involving large tables where hash joins are efficient (e.g., when joining tables with 10,000+ rows), or disable it (`off` or `false`) to force nested loop or merge joins if hash joins perform poorly (e.g., for small tables under 1,000 rows or with low cardinality). Adjust based on query plan analysis and benchmarking.
