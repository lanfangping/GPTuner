To set the `enable_seqscan` knob in PostgreSQL, typically disable it (`SET enable_seqscan = off;`) when query performance testing shows index scans are significantly faster (e.g., 2â€“10x improvement), but leave it enabled (`on`) by default to allow the planner to use sequential scans for small tables or when indexes are ineffective.  

(Example: Disable it for large-table queries where index scans reduce execution time from 500ms to 50ms.)
