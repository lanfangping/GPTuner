To set the `fsync` knob in PostgreSQL, typically enable it (`fsync = on`) for data durability (default), or disable it (`fsync = off`) only for non-critical workloads where performance is prioritized over crash recovery, though this risks data corruption if the system crashes. Adjust `wal_writer_delay` (default: 200ms) or `commit_delay`/`commit_siblings` if tuning write latency. Always ensure `full_page_writes = on` (default) when `fsync` is enabled.
