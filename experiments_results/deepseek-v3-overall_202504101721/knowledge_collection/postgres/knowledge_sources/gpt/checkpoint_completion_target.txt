To set `checkpoint_completion_target` in PostgreSQL, typically configure it to **0.7–0.9** (70–90%) to balance I/O load during checkpoints while avoiding spikes, ensuring checkpoints complete before the next one starts based on `checkpoint_timeout` (default 5min) and write activity. Adjust higher (e.g., **0.9**) for smoother I/O but ensure `max_wal_size` accommodates the workload.
