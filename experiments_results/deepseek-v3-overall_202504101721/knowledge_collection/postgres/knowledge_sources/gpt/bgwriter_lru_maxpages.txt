To set `bgwriter_lru_maxpages`, a good starting point is **100–1000 pages per cycle** (default 100), adjusted based on system load: lower values (e.g., 100–200) for conservative I/O or small systems, higher values (e.g., 500–1000) for write-heavy workloads, but avoid exceeding 25% (`bgwriter_lru_multiplier`-adjusted) of `shared_buffers` to prevent contention. Monitor `buffers_backend` vs. `buffers_alloc` in `pg_stat_bgwriter`—if backend writes are high, increase it incrementally (e.g., by 100).
