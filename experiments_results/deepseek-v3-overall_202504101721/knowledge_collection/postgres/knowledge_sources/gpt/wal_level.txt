To set the `wal_level` knob in PostgreSQL, choose one of the following values based on your needs: `minimal` (default, no replication), `replica` (for physical replication and logical decoding), or `logical` (for logical replication and decoding); for example, use `replica` for streaming replication (`ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'replica';`).
