To set the `shared_buffers` knob in PostgreSQL, a common recommendation is to allocate **25% of available RAM** (but not exceeding 8GB) for dedicated database servers—for example, **8GB on a 32GB system**—while ensuring it aligns with the workload (e.g., OLTP may benefit from higher values, while smaller systems might start with **1GB or 10% of RAM**). Always validate with testing.
