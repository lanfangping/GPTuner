"The 'enable_nestloop' parameter controls the query planner's use of nested-loop joins, defaulting to 'on' (enabled), but when set to 'off,' it discourages their use unless no alternative join methods (e.g., hash or merge joins) are available."  

*(Note: While the description doesn't provide concrete numerical thresholds, this summarizes the behavior concisely. If specific planner cost or selectivity numbers were referenced, they could be included.)*
