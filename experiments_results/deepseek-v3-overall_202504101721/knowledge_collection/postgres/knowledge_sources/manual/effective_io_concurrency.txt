The `effective_io_concurrency` knob sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations PostgreSQL expects (range: 1–1000, or 0 to disable), with recommended values starting at the number of drives in a RAID 0/1 array (excluding RAID 5 parity) for magnetic disks (e.g., 2–8), while SSDs may benefit from values in the hundreds (e.g., 200–300), defaulting to 1 if supported or 0 otherwise.
