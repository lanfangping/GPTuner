The `statement_timeout` knob aborts any statement exceeding the specified duration (default: 0, disabled; unitless values are treated as milliseconds), measured from command arrival to completion, with individual timeouts per statement in simple-Query messages (pre-13 PostgreSQL applied it to the entire query string), and is not recommended in postgresql.conf to avoid session-wide impact.
