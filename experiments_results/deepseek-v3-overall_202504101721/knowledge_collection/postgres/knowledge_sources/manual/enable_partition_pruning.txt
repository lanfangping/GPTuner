"The 'enable_partition_pruning' knob controls the query planner's ability to exclude irrelevant partitions from query plans, improving performance by reducing scanned data, and is enabled by default (on) as detailed in Section 5.11.4."  

*(If a concrete number were available—e.g., "reducing query runtime by up to 70% for large partitioned tables"—it could be added, but the original text lacks such metrics.)*
