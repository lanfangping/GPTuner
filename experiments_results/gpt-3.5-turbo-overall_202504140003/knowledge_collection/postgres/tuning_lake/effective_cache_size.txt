{'suggestion': "Set the 'effective_cache_size' knob in PostgreSQL to system RAM - (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) * 1.1, or a lower value if the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL. This setting influences the planner's assumption about the effective size of the disk cache available to a query. Higher values favor index scans, while lower values favor sequential scans."}
