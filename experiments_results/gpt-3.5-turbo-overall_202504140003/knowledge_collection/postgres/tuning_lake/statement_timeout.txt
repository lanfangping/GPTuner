{'suggestion': "Configure the 'statement_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL to prevent statements from running indefinitely. By setting a specific timeout value, you can ensure that queries are aborted if they exceed the specified time limit. It is advisable to set this timeout at the session level rather than in the postgresql.conf file to avoid affecting all sessions. The default value is zero milliseconds, disabling the timeout feature."}
