{'suggestion': "Adjust the 'random_page_cost' parameter in the database planner settings to optimize the cost estimate for non-sequentially fetched disk pages. The default value is 4.0, but it can be fine-tuned to prioritize index scans or accurately represent the cost of random storage reads. Consider lowering the value, such as to 1.1, for storage systems with low random read costs like solid-state drives."}
