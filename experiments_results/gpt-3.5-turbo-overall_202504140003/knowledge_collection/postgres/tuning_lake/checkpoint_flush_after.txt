{'suggestion': "Consider adjusting the 'checkpoint_flush_after' parameter to optimize the timing of writes to storage during a checkpoint. The default value is 256kB on Linux and 0 elsewhere, with a range between 0 and 2MB. This adjustment can help enhance the efficiency of the checkpoint process and improve overall system performance."}
