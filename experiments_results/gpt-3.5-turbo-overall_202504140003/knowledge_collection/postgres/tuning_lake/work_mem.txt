{'suggestion': "To optimize Postgres performance, adjust the 'work_mem' parameter based on the memory usage in your queries. For OLTP queries without complex joins, keep it in the low MBs; for OLAP-style queries with few concurrent operations, increase it to the GB range. Estimate the total memory potential consumed by multiplying by max_connections * N. Be cautious not to set it too low, causing disk usage, or too high, affecting node throughput. Monitor and adjust the 'work_mem' knob to balance memory usage and query performance efficiently."}
