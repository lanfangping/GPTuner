{'suggestion': "Consider adjusting the 'join_collapse_limit' variable to potentially improve planning time for queries. Lower values can result in faster planning but may lead to suboptimal query plans. The default value of 'join_collapse_limit' is the same as 'from_collapse_limit'. Evaluate the impact on query performance before making significant changes."}
