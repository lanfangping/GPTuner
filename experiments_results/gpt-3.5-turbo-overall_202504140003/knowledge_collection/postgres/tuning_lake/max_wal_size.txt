{'suggestion': 'To optimize database performance and reliability, consider adjusting the max_wal_size knob setting. Unless there are disk space constraints, it is advisable to raise this value to ensure that automatic checkpoints are primarily caused by timeout rather than disk space limitations. By increasing the max_wal_size value, the recovery time after a database crash can be extended. The default value for max_wal_size is 1 GB in megabytes, serving as a soft limit on the WAL size growth during automatic checkpoints.'}
