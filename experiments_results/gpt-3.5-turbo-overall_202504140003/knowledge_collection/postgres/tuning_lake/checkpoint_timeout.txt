{'suggestion': "Consider adjusting the 'checkpoint_timeout' parameter in PostgreSQL to determine the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints. Normally, raising this parameter can lead to larger I/O spikes and recovery time after a database crash. However, more frequent checkpoints can increase I/O usage. The valid range for this parameter is between 30 seconds and one day, with a default value of five minutes (5min)."}
