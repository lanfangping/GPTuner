To set the value for the knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' in PostgreSQL, you should consider increasing it from the default of 200 to 1,000 or more in order to allow autovacuum to work more aggressively, particularly on larger databases where system I/O capacity can handle additional load without impacting performance adversely.
