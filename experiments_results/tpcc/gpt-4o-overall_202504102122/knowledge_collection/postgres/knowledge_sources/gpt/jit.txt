The 'jit' knob in PostgreSQL enables or disables Just-In-Time compilation, and to set its value, use 'jit = on' to enable it for potentially improved query performance, especially for complex queries, while setting it to 'jit = off' may be beneficial in simpler query scenarios or when minimal performance gain is observed.
