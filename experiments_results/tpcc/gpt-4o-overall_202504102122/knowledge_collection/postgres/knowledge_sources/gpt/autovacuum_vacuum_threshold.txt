To set the value for the 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' knob in PostgreSQL, a common recommendation is to use a baseline value of 50, which dictates the minimum number of tuple updates or deletes that must occur before an automatic vacuum is triggered, and this can be adjusted based on the specific workload and the frequency of updates on your tables to maintain database performance.
