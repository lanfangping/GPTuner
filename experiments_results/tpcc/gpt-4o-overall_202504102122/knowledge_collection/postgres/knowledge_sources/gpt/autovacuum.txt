The 'autovacuum' knob in PostgreSQL should be set to 'on' (the default) to enable automatic vacuuming and analyze processes, ensuring optimal database performance by removing dead tuples and updating table statistics; fine-tuning involves adjusting related parameters like 'autovacuum_max_workers' (default is 3) and 'autovacuum_naptime' (default is 1 minute) based on workload and system resources.
