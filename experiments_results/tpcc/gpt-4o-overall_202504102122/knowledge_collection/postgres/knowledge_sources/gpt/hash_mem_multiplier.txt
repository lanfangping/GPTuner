To set the value for the 'hash_mem_multiplier' knob in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 1.0 and adjust it based on workload requirements, keeping in mind that higher values may improve performance for hash-intensive queries but can also increase memory usage, so adjustments should be made incrementally while monitoring system performance.
