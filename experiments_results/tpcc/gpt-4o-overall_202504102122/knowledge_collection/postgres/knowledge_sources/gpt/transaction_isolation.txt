To set the 'transaction_isolation' knob in PostgreSQL, you can use the SQL command `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` followed by the desired levelâ€”options include `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, or `SERIALIZABLE`, with `READ COMMITTED` being the default level, balancing performance and consistency for most transactions.
