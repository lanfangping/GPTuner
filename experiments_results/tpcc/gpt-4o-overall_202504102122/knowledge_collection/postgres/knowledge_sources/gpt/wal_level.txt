The "wal_level" knob in PostgreSQL determines the amount of write-ahead logging information collected, with settings such as "minimal" for basic crash recovery, "replica" for streaming replication without logical decoding, and "logical" for logical replication, where you can adjust for performance and replication needs by increasing from "minimal" to "logical" based on the complexity of the system and replication requirements.
