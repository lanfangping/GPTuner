For the `fsync` knob in PostgreSQL, it is typically recommended to keep it set to "on" (the default setting) to ensure data durability, but if performance is critically impaired and you're willing to risk potential data loss, you can set it to "off"; however, this is generally discouraged except in testing environments.
