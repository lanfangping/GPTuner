To set the value for 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, consider starting with the default value of 0.1, which triggers an analyze operation when 10% of the table's data has changed, and adjust it based on your database activity and performance requirementsâ€”reducing it to around 0.05 for high-transaction tables can lead to more frequent statistics updates, while increasing it to 0.2 may be suitable for tables with infrequent updates.
