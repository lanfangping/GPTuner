To set the value for the PostgreSQL 'parallel_tuple_cost' knob, it is generally advised to start with the default value of 0.1 and then adjust it based on your specific workload characteristics, where increasing the value discourages parallel plans by attributing a higher cost to processing individual tuples in parallel, which may be necessary if parallel processing overhead outweighs its benefits for smaller datasets or queries.
