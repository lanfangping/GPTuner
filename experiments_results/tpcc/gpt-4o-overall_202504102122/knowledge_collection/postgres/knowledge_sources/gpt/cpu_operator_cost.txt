To set the value for the 'cpu_operator_cost' knob in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 0.0025 and adjust it based on your system's performance and workload characteristics, often through testing with your specific query patterns and hardware setup; for highly CPU-efficient systems, you may consider decreasing it slightly, whereas for systems with less CPU efficiency, a slight increase may help optimize query planning.
