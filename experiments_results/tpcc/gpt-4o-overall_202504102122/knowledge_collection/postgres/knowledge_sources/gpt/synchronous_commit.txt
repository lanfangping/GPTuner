To set the value for the 'synchronous_commit' knob in PostgreSQL, consider the trade-off between performance and data safety: set it to 'off' for maximum performance with potential data loss risk during a crash, 'remote_apply' for ensuring changes are applied and visible on a synchronous standby for maximum data safety, or 'local'/'remote_write' as intermediate options, balancing performance and durability.
