The `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor` determines the additional fraction (20% by default) of a table's size added to the `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` to decide when to trigger a VACUUM, and it can be configured only via the postgresql.conf file or server command line, but overridden for individual tables through table storage settings.
