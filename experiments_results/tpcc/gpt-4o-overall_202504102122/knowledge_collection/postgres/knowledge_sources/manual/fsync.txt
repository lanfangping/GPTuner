The 'fsync' parameter in PostgreSQL, which can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line, ensures data integrity by physically writing updates to disk, but turning it off improves performance at the risk of data corruption in events like power failures, making it advisable to disable only if the database can be easily recreated, such as during initial batch processing or in read-only database clones.
