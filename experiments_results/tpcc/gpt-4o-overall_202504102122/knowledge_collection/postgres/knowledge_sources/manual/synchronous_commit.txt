The "synchronous_commit" knob determines the level of WAL processing required before a transaction is considered successfully committed, with options like "remote_apply", "on" (default), "remote_write", "local", and "off", where "off" allows for possible transaction loss in exchange for performance gains, while "on" ensures transaction durability unless both primary and all synchronous standbys fail, with delays potentially up to three times "wal_writer_delay".
