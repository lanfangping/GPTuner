The `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` specifies that a VACUUM is triggered after 1000 inserted tuples by default, but can be disabled by setting it to -1, and can only be configured in the postgresql.conf file or server command line, with individual table adjustments allowed through storage parameter changes.
