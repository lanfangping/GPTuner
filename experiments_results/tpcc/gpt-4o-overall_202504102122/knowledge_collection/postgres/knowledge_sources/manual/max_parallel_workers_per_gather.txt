The 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' knob sets the limit of workers for a Gather or Gather Merge node, with a default of 2, and can be disabled by setting it to 0; parallel queries may significantly increase system resource consumption, using up to 5 times more resources with 4 workers than non-parallel queries.
