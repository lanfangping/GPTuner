The 'bgwriter_flush_after' setting specifies that once the background writer has written more than 512kB of data on Linux (or defaults to 0 on other platforms), it attempts to force the OS to flush these writes to storage to manage the kernel's page cache better, with the option to adjust this between 0 and 2MB.
