The 'wal_sync_method' defines how to force WAL updates to disk, with options including 'open_datasync', 'fdatasync', 'fsync', 'fsync_writethrough', and 'open_sync', where 'fdatasync' is the default on Linux and FreeBSD, but the optimal choice may vary based on platform support and desired performance.
