The 'effective_io_concurrency' setting in PostgreSQL, which ranges from 1 to 1000 (or 0 to disable), determines the number of concurrent disk I/O operations expected to be executed simultaneously, impacting primarily bitmap heap scans, and can start at the number of drives in RAID configurations for magnetic drives or potentially hundreds for SSDs, though excessive values may lead to unnecessary CPU overhead, and it defaults to 1 on systems supporting the required posix_fadvise function.
