The `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` knob determines the maximum number of parallel workers that can be used by a single utility command, like `CREATE INDEX` for B-tree indexes and non-FULL `VACUUM`, with a default of 2 workers; setting it to 0 disables parallelism, and the total memory consumption is constrained by `maintenance_work_mem` rather than per worker, though CPU and I/O usage may still increase.
