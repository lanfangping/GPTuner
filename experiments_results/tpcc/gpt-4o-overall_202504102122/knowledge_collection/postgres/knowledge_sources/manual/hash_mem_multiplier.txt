The knob 'hash_mem_multiplier' determines the limit on memory usage for hash-based operations by multiplying the work_mem (default limit is 1.0), and it can be increased to 1.5 or 2.0 for mixed workloads or even up to 8.0 in environments where work_mem exceeds 40MB and memory pressure issues are encountered.
