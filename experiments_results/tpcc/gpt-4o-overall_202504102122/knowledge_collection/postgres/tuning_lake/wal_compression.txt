{'suggestion': "Enable the 'wal_compression' parameter in PostgreSQL to compress full page images during the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) process. This can significantly reduce WAL volume, which is beneficial for systems with high write workloads. However, be aware that enabling this feature will increase CPU usage during both logging and replay processes. The default setting is 'off', and it can only be modified by superusers."}
