{'suggestion': "The 'enable_parallel_append' knob in PostgreSQL should be set to 'on' (true) to allow the query planner to utilize parallel-aware append plan types. This setting is enabled by default and can improve performance for queries that scan multiple partitions or tables concurrently, depending on your system's workload and parallel execution capabilities."}
