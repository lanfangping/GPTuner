{'suggestion': 'To configure the `bgwriter_lru_maxpages` parameter in PostgreSQL, which defaults to 100 buffers, you can adjust this value upwards to increase the activity of the background writer, especially on busy databases. This parameter limits the number of buffers the background writer can write per round and can be set in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. If necessary, you have the option to disable background writing by setting this parameter to zero. Performance testing is recommended to determine the optimal setting for your specific workload.'}
