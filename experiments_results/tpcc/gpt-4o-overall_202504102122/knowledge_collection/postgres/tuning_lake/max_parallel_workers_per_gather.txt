{'suggestion': "When configuring the 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' setting in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 2 and adjust based on your system's needs. For analytical or data warehouse systems, consider increasing the value, ensuring it remains a fraction of your available CPU cores to prevent excessive resource consumption. For high throughput OLTP systems, it is advisable to keep the value at 1 or 2 to avoid performance degradation. Be mindful that parallel queries can significantly increase resource usage, potentially up to 5 times more with 4 workers compared to non-parallel queries, and adjust the 'work_mem' setting accordingly to optimize performance."}
