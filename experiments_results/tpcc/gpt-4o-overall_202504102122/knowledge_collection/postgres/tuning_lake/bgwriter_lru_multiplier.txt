{'suggestion': "The 'bgwriter_lru_multiplier' parameter in PostgreSQL should be set starting at its default value of 2.0. This setting helps estimate the number of buffers needed for the next round by multiplying the recent average buffer need, providing a balance between immediate write needs and cushioning against demand spikes. Adjustments can be made incrementally if necessary, but typically values above 4.0 are rarely needed. This parameter works in conjunction with 'bgwriter_lru_maxpages' to determine the limit of proactive buffer cleaning."}
