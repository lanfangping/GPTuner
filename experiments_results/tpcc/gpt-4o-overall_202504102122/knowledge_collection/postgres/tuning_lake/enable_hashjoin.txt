{'suggestion': "The 'enable_hashjoin' knob in PostgreSQL allows the query planner to utilize hash-join plan types, with the default setting being enabled. To adjust this setting, you can modify the configuration file (postgresql.conf) to either 'on' or 'off'. This change can also be made temporarily in a session using the command `SET enable_hashjoin = off;`."}
