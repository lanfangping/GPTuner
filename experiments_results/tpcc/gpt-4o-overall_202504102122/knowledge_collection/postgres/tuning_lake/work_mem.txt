{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'work_mem' setting in PostgreSQL, begin with a base of 4MB per connection, recognizing that this default may be too small for modern systems. For OLTP queries that do not require complex operations, this value can remain in the low MB range. However, for OLAP-style queries or complex operations, consider increasing the 'work_mem' to 16MB or more, potentially up to 1-5% of RAM, while ensuring the total memory usage across all connections remains within the system's available memory. Adjust based on the memory usage patterns observed in your queries, and be cautious of destabilizing throughput with too high a setting, especially during concurrent sessions. For hash-based operations, consider the effect of the hash_mem_multiplier, which can increase memory usage beyond the base 'work_mem' setting."}
