{'suggestion': "To configure the 'checkpoint_timeout' parameter in PostgreSQL, set it in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. The default value is 5 minutes, which balances performance and data durability. Consider adjusting it based on your system's write workload. Increasing this parameter can lead to larger I/O spikes and longer recovery times after a crash, but it generally improves I/O efficiency by reducing the frequency of checkpoints. For smoother performance, tune related settings like checkpoint_completion_target and bgwriter activity."}
