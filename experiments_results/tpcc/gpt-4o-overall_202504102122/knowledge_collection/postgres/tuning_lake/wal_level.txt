{'suggestion': "The 'wal_level' parameter in PostgreSQL, set at server start, controls the amount of data written to the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL). It offers three settings: 'minimal', 'replica', and 'logical'. 'Minimal' is suitable for basic crash recovery by writing the least amount of data. 'Replica', the default setting, supports WAL archiving and replication. 'Logical' adds extra details necessary for logical decoding and is ideal for logical replication but significantly increases WAL volume, especially for tables with 'REPLICA IDENTITY FULL' during frequent UPDATE and DELETE operations. Adjust the 'wal_level' based on your system's complexity and replication needs, transitioning from 'minimal' to 'logical' as required. Note that previous values like 'archive' and 'hot_standby' are now equivalent to 'replica'."}
