{'suggestion': "The 'enable_indexscan' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of index-scan and index-only-scan plan types. It is set to 'on' by default, which allows the use of these scans where applicable to optimize query performance. You can change this setting using the command `SET enable_indexscan = on;` to enable or `SET enable_indexscan = off;` to disable index scans."}
