{'suggestion': "For tuning the 'autovacuum_work_mem' knob in PostgreSQL, set its value to specify the maximum memory each autovacuum worker process can use. The default is -1, which means it uses 'maintenance_work_mem'. This setting can utilize up to 1GB for collecting dead tuples, with any higher setting having no additional effect. Adjust the value based on your database workload and system memory, starting from a baseline and scaling as necessary based on performance observations and available resources."}
