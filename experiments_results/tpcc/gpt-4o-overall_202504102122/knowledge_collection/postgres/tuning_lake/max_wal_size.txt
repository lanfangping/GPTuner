{'suggestion': "To configure the 'max_wal_size' in PostgreSQL, begin with the default value of 1GB and adjust it according to your workload needs. This setting acts as a soft limit on the WAL size during automatic checkpoints and can exceed the default under heavy load or if 'wal_keep_size' is high. It is advisable to increase 'max_wal_size' to accommodate larger transaction volumes, which can reduce the frequency of checkpoints and improve performance. However, be mindful that increasing this value will also increase the recovery time after a database crash. Ensure that changes are made in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line, and consider disk space constraints when making adjustments to avoid automatic checkpoints being triggered by disk space issues."}
