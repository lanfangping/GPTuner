{'suggestion': "To configure 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' in PostgreSQL, set the parameter in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. The default value is 2 milliseconds, but it can be adjusted based on your system's needs. If necessary, set it to -1 to use 'vacuum_cost_delay'. Adjust the delay upwards in small increments if autovacuum processes are impacting system performance, while keeping in mind that higher values may lead to increased table bloat. Table-specific overrides can be applied through storage parameters."}
