{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' in PostgreSQL, start with the default setting of triggering a VACUUM after 1,000 inserted tuples. This configuration can be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line, and specific table settings can be modified through storage parameter changes. Consider increasing the threshold in write-heavy environments to reduce autovacuum frequency, or decreasing it if timely vacuuming of insert-only tables is critical for maintaining performance."}
