{'suggestion': "To configure 'max_worker_processes' in Postgres, set it to a default of 8, ensuring it is equal or greater on a standby server than on a master server to allow queries. This setting must be configured at server start. Consider adjusting this value based on your system's CPU core count and workload requirements, typically aiming for a value between 75% and 90% of the number of CPU cores for optimal parallel processing performance."}
