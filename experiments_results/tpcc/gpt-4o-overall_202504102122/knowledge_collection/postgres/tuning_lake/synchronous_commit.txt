{'suggestion': "For setting the 'synchronous_commit' knob in PostgreSQL, consider the level of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) processing appropriate for your needs. The 'on' setting, which is the default, ensures transaction durability unless both the primary and all synchronous standbys fail, with potential delays up to three times 'wal_writer_delay'. If performance is a higher priority than data safety, you can set it to 'off', accepting the risk of possible transaction loss. Alternatively, 'remote_apply' provides maximum data safety by ensuring changes are applied and visible on a synchronous standby, while 'local' and 'remote_write' offer intermediate options balancing performance and durability."}
