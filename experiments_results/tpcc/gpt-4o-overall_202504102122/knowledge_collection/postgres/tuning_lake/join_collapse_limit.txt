{'suggestion': "The 'join_collapse_limit' in PostgreSQL should be configured to control the number of FROM items the planner rewrites JOIN constructs into. It defaults to a value that matches 'from_collapse_limit' and can be set to prevent reordering of explicit JOINs. Setting it to values at or above 'geqo_threshold' may trigger the GEQO planner, which could result in non-optimal plans. For typical use, adjust this setting based on the complexity of your queries: use lower values for simpler queries to minimize planning time and higher values for complex queries to allow the planner to explore more join order possibilities."}
