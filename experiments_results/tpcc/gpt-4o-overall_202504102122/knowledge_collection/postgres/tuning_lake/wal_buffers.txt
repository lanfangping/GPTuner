{'suggestion': "For optimizing write performance in PostgreSQL, especially on busy servers, manually set the 'wal_buffers' parameter to a value above 32kB. This parameter determines the shared memory allocated for WAL data before it's written to disk. While it defaults to 3% of 'shared_buffers', manual tuning can be beneficial. Starting with a setting of 16MB is recommended for systems with high write workloads, as this can help enhance performance."}
