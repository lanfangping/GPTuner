{'suggestion': "The 'enable_nestloop' knob in PostgreSQL, which defaults to 'on', manages the query planner's preference for nested-loop joins. While deactivation discourages their use when alternative methods are available, it does not eliminate them entirely. This setting is beneficial for workloads that perform well with nested loops, but it can be turned 'off' to prevent their use when they lead to performance issues."}
