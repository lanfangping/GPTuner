{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `seq_page_cost` parameter in PostgreSQL sets the planner's estimated cost for a sequential disk page fetch, with a default value of 1.0. It can be customized for specific tablespaces using the tablespace parameter (see ALTER TABLESPACE). Additionally, consider adjusting this value based on the storage type and speed, such as reducing it for fast SSDs or increasing it for slower disks, to better reflect the actual cost of reading a page in a sequential scan."}
