{'suggestion': "To effectively configure the 'log_min_duration_statement' knob in PostgreSQL, set a threshold in milliseconds to log SQL statements that exceed this execution time. Avoid setting it to '0' unless your service consistently experiences low traffic, as this could overwhelm a busy server. A reasonable starting point might be 250 milliseconds, but adjust based on your application's needs. Note that only superusers can modify this setting, and it overrides sampling settings to log all queries surpassing the specified duration. Additionally, consider using tools like pg_stat_statements or pg_stat_monitor to gain deeper insights into query performance."}
