{'suggestion': "Configure the 'wal_writer_flush_after' parameter in PostgreSQL to control when the WAL writer flushes data to disk. The default setting is 1MB, equivalent to about 128 WAL blocks if XLOG_BLCKSZ is 8kB. Set this parameter based on your specific disk I/O and latency requirements to balance performance and durability. If set to 0, WAL data is immediately flushed to disk. This setting can only be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file or through the server command line."}
