{'suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL is a configuration parameter that determines when a VACUUM operation should be triggered. It is calculated as a fraction of a table's size added to the 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold'. This setting is configured in the 'postgresql.conf' file or via the server command line, and can also be overridden for specific tables using table storage parameters. Typically, the scale factor is set to around 0.1 for frequently updated tables and closer to 0.2 for less active tables, meaning autovacuum will trigger when 10% or 20% of the table has been updated, respectively."}
