{'suggestion': "The 'parallel_tuple_cost' knob in PostgreSQL sets the planner's cost estimate for transferring a tuple between parallel processes. It is recommended to begin with the default value of 0.1. Adjustments can be made based on specific workload characteristics, where increasing the value may be beneficial if the overhead of parallel processing outweighs its advantages, particularly for smaller datasets or queries."}
