{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold' in PostgreSQL, set a baseline of 50 inserted, updated, or deleted tuples to trigger an ANALYZE operation. This setting can be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line, and further customized per table using storage parameters. Adjust this baseline based on specific workload and table size to effectively manage the frequency of analyze operations, ensuring up-to-date table statistics and optimized query performance."}
