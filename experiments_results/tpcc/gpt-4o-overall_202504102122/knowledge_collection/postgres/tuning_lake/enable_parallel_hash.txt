{'suggestion': "The 'enable_parallel_hash' knob in PostgreSQL is enabled by default and allows the query planner to use hash-join plan types with parallel hash. This feature can enhance performance for suitable queries by utilizing parallel hash joins, depending on the query execution plans and system resources. To manage this setting, use the command `SET enable_parallel_hash = {on | off};`, where 'on' enables and 'off' disables the parallel hash joins."}
