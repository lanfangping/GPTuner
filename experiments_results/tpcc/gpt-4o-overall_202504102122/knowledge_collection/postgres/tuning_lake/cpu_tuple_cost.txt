{'suggestion': "The 'cpu_tuple_cost' knob in PostgreSQL sets the estimated cost per row processed during a query, with a default value of 0.01. This value reflects the cost of CPU usage for executing operations on a tuple. It is recommended to adjust this value based on empirical testing and workload characteristics to optimize performance."}
