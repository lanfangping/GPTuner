{'suggestion': "For the 'effective_io_concurrency' setting in PostgreSQL, configure it to reflect the number of concurrent disk I/O operations expected, which primarily affects bitmap heap scans. This is particularly relevant for systems using SSDs, where the value can be set to potentially hundreds, starting at the number of drives in RAID configurations for magnetic drives. However, be cautious of setting excessively high values as they might introduce unnecessary CPU overhead. The default value is 1 on systems that support the posix_fadvise function."}
