{'suggestion': "The 'jit' knob in PostgreSQL controls the use of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and is set to 'on' by default, offering potential performance enhancements. It is recommended to keep it enabled for complex queries to improve query performance. However, for OLTP systems with simple queries, you may consider disabling it, as the performance gain in such scenarios might be minimal."}
