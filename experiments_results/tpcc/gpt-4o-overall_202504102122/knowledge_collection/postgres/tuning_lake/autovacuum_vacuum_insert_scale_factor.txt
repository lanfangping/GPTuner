{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, understand that it determines the additional fraction (20% by default) of a table's size added to the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' to decide when to trigger a VACUUM. This setting can be adjusted based on your workload: increase the scale factor for workloads with frequent insertions and high table growth to delay autovacuum, or decrease it for more aggressive vacuuming of rapidly growing tables. Configuration can be done via the postgresql.conf file or server command line, and it can be overridden for individual tables through table storage settings."}
