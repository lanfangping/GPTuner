{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'hash_mem_multiplier' knob in PostgreSQL, adjust the value to manage memory usage effectively for hash-based operations. Begin with the default setting and consider increasing it to 1.5 or 2.0 for mixed workloads, or up to 8.0 if the work_mem exceeds 40MB and memory pressure issues arise. Monitor system performance closely to ensure that any changes improve performance without causing excessive memory usage."}
