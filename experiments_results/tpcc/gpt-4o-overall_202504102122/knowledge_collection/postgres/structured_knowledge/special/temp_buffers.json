{"think_procedure": "First, identify if 'temp_buffers' is a numerical knob. 'temp_buffers' is a configuration setting in PostgreSQL that determines the amount of memory allocated for temporary tables. It is expressed in kilobytes. Next, determine if it has specific values that alter its behavior significantly from its regular numerical operation. In PostgreSQL, 'temp_buffers' does not have special values like -1 or 0 that disable it or change its functionality drastically. It is simply a memory allocation setting that follows a natural order and does not have exceptions like disabling features at specific values. Therefore, it does not qualify as a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
