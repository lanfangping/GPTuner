{"think_procedure": "First, identify the purpose of the 'effective_cache_size' knob in PostgreSQL. It is used to estimate the size of the disk cache available to a single query. Next, determine if there are any special values that alter its behavior significantly. Typical special values for knobs include -1 or 0, which might disable a feature or change its operation. Check PostgreSQL documentation or resources to see if 'effective_cache_size' has such special values. If no special values are found, classify it as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
