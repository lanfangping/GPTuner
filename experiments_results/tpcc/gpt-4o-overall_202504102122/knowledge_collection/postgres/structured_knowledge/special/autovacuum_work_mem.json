{"think_procedure": "First, identify if the knob 'autovacuum_work_mem' has special values that alter its behavior significantly compared to its typical numerical range. In PostgreSQL, 'autovacuum_work_mem' specifies the amount of memory to be used by each autovacuum worker process. Typically, this is a positive integer representing memory size in kilobytes. However, a special value of -1 indicates that the system should use the setting of 'maintenance_work_mem' instead. This special value breaks the natural numerical order as it does not represent a memory size directly but rather a directive to use another configuration setting. Hence, this knob is classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
