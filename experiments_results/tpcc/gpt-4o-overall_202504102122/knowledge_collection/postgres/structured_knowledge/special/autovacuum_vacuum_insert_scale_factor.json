{"think_procedure": "First, identify if the knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly compared to its regular numerical range. In PostgreSQL, a 'special knob' typically has specific values like -1 or 0 that enable or disable features or change the behavior drastically. Check the documentation or resources for this specific knob to determine if such values exist. For 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor', it is primarily a numerical knob that dictates the scale factor for autovacuuming based on insert operations, and does not have any special values like -1 or 0 that would disable or significantly alter its behavior. Therefore, it does not classify as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
