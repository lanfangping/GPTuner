{"think_procedure": "The 'fsync' knob in PostgreSQL is used to control whether the database engine forces changes to be written to disk immediately. This is a boolean setting, not a numerical one, and it usually takes the values 'on' or 'off'. When 'fsync' is set to 'off', it disables the feature that ensures data is safely written to disk, which can improve performance but at the risk of data loss in case of a crash. Since it is a boolean setting, it does not have a natural numerical order or special numerical values like -1 or 0 that alter its behavior. Therefore, it does not fit the definition of a 'special numerical knob' that has special values breaking a natural order. It is simply a toggle between two states.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
