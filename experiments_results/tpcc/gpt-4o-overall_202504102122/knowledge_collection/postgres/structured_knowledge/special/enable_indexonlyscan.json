{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_indexonlyscan' is a configuration setting in PostgreSQL that controls whether index-only scans are considered in query planning. This knob is a boolean setting, meaning it can only be true or false, rather than a numerical setting with a range of values. Boolean settings do not have special numerical values like -1 or 0 that change the behavior of the setting in a unique way compared to a range of numerical values. Therefore, it does not have a special value that breaks a natural numerical order, as it does not operate on a numerical scale.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
