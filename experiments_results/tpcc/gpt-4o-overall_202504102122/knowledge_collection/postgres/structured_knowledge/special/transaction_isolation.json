{"think_procedure": "The knob 'transaction_isolation' in PostgreSQL is used to set the isolation level of a transaction. It is not a numerical knob but rather a categorical one. The possible values for transaction_isolation are 'read uncommitted', 'read committed', 'repeatable read', and 'serializable'. These values do not have a special numerical value like -1 or 0 that changes the behavior of the knob dramatically. Instead, each value represents a different level of isolation. Therefore, 'transaction_isolation' does not meet the criteria of having special numerical values that alter its function, as it is not a numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
