{"think_procedure": "First, we need to understand the purpose of the 'cpu_index_tuple_cost' knob in PostgreSQL. This knob is used to set the planner's estimate of the cost of processing each index entry during a database query. Typically, this value is set as a positive number representing cost. Next, we need to determine if there are any special values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior significantly, such as disabling a feature or performing a different function. After checking the PostgreSQL documentation and resources, there is no indication that 'cpu_index_tuple_cost' has a special value that alters its fundamental behavior. It behaves as a regular numerical knob where the value represents a cost estimation. Therefore, it does not have a special value that breaks its natural order.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
