{"think_procedure": "First, identify the purpose and behavior of the 'max_wal_size' knob in PostgreSQL. The 'max_wal_size' setting determines the maximum size to let the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) grow. Next, determine if there are any special values that change the behavior of this knob significantly. In PostgreSQL, 'max_wal_size' is typically set in terms of size (e.g., MB or GB), and there is no indication that values like -1 or 0 are used to disable or alter its function radically. Therefore, 'max_wal_size' behaves like a regular numerical knob without special values that break its natural order.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
