{"think_procedure": "First, we need to determine the typical behavior of the 'hash_mem_multiplier' knob in PostgreSQL. This involves understanding its purpose, which is to adjust the amount of memory allocated for hash operations relative to the work_mem setting. Typically, numerical knobs in PostgreSQL have a natural order, meaning they increase or decrease linearly in effect as the numerical value changes. However, to classify it as a 'special knob', we need to check if there are any specific values that cause the knob to behave differently, such as disabling a feature or performing a distinct function. In this case, we look for documentation or resources that indicate if 'hash_mem_multiplier' has such special values. Upon review, there is no indication that 'hash_mem_multiplier' has a special value like -1 or 0 that alters its fundamental behavior or disables a feature. It simply scales the hash memory allocation linearly based on its value.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
