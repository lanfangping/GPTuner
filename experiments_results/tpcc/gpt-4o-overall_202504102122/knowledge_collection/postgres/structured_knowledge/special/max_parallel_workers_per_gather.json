{"think_procedure": "First, identify the purpose of the knob 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather'. This knob controls the maximum number of parallel workers that can be used for a single gather node in a query plan. Next, determine if there are any special values that alter its behavior significantly compared to its normal operation. In PostgreSQL, a setting of 0 for 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' is a special value that effectively disables parallelism for gather nodes, which is a distinct behavior compared to other positive integer settings that increase parallelism. Thus, this knob is classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
