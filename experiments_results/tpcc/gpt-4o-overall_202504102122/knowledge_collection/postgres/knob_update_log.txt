This setting influences the planner's assumptions about available disk cache size for query estimation, affecting whether index or sequential scans are favored. A common approach is to set it to approximately the system RAM minus the sum of (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) multiplied by 1.1, or a lower value if the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL. This configuration does not impact the actual amount of physical RAM used by queries."}
