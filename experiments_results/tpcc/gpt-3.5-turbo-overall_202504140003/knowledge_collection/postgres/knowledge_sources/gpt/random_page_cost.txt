To set the value for the knob 'random_page_cost' in PostgreSQL, you can start by analyzing your specific storage configuration and workload and adjusting the value typically between 1.1 and 4.0 (the default is 4.0) to better reflect the relative cost of random page fetches compared to linear page fetches.
