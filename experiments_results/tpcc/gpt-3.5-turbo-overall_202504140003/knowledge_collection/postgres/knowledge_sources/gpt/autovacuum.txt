To set the value for the 'autovacuum' knob in Postgres, adjust the autovacuum_vacuum_threshold parameter to specify the minimum number of dead tuples needed to trigger a VACUUM operation, and the autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor parameter to determine the fraction of the table that must have been modified before a VACUUM operation is triggered.
