To set the value for the 'synchronous_commit' knob in Postgres, you can specify it in the postgresql.conf file by setting it to either 'on' for immediate commits or 'off' for asynchronous commits, or using values such as 'local' or 'remote_write' to control the level of synchronization with 2 available options: 'on' or 'off'.
