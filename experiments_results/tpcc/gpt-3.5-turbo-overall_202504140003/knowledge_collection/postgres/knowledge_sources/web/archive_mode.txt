As a common and recommended practice, in order to avoid unnecessary database restarts, set it to ‘on’ and configure the archive_command accordingly (see archive_command). However, archiving is recommended in any environment that requires backups and data consistency. You may leave it disabled for databases which are not the source of truth or which are used just for testing purposes, to minimize the storage used.
