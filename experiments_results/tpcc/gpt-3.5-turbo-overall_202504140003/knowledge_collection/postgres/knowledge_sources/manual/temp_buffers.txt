The 'temp_buffers' knob sets the maximum amount of memory used for session-local temporary buffers used for temporary tables within each database session, with a default value of 8MB that can be changed before the first use of temporary tables in a session, with each increment costing about 64 bytes for buffer descriptors and 8192 bytes for each buffer actually used.
