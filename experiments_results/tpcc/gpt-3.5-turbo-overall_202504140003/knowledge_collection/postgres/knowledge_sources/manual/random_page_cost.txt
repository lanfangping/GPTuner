The 'random_page_cost' parameter sets the planner's cost estimate for non-sequentially fetched disk pages, with a default value of 4.0, but can be adjusted to prefer index scans or reflect the true cost of random storage reads, with values as low as 1.1 for storage with low random read costs like solid-state drives.
