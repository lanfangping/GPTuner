I first give you a knob of postgres and its tuning suggestion, please judge whether the tuning suggestion is related to the given hardware sources.Note that a knob may be related to more than one class.

KNOB:
checkpoint_flush_after
TUNING_SUGGESTION:
{'suggestion': "Consider adjusting the 'checkpoint_flush_after' parameter to optimize the timing of writes to storage during a checkpoint. The default value is 256kB on Linux and 0 elsewhere, with a range between 0 and 2MB. This adjustment can help enhance the efficiency of the checkpoint process and improve overall system performance."}

Now think step by step, and give me the result in json format. If the suggestion is related to the resource, put true as the value. If not, return false.
JSON RESULT TEMPLATE:
{
    "cpu_related": // Set as Boolean true if CPU-related, otherwise false
    "ram_related": // Set as Boolean true if RAM-related, otherwise false
    "disk_size_related": // Set as Boolean true if disk size-related, otherwise false
    "disk_type_related": // Set as Boolean true if disk type-related, otherwise false
}
