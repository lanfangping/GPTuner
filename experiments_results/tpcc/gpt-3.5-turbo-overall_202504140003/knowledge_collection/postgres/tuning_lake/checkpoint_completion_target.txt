{'suggestion': "Adjust the value of the 'checkpoint_completion_target' knob in Postgres to control the frequency of checkpoints completion. It is recommended to set the value between 0.5 and 0.9 for a more aggressive approach. This knob determines the target completion rate for checkpoints, with the default set at 50% of the time between checkpoints. To smooth I/O activity of checkpoints over larger periods of time, raise the value. If feeding non-streaming replicas, keep the value within a low percentage. On development instances, it is common to set it to '0.9'."}
