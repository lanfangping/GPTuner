{'suggestion': "Consider raising the 'vacuum_cost_limit' parameter to improve I/O usage. A higher value can lead to larger I/O spikes and recovery time after a database crash, but it can also result in more frequent checkpoints, ultimately improving I/O usage. The 'vacuum_cost_limit' knob specifies the threshold cost at which the vacuuming process will pause."}
