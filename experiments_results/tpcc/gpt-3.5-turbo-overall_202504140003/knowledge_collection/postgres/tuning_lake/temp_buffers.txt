{'suggestion': "Adjust the 'temp_buffers' knob to optimize the maximum amount of memory used for session-local temporary buffers in each database session. The default value is 8MB, but it can be changed before the first use of temporary tables. Each increment will cost approximately 64 bytes for buffer descriptors and 8192 bytes for each buffer used."}
