{'suggestion': "To optimize database performance, it is recommended to use connection pooling for most use cases. When using connection pooling in transaction mode, set the parameter as a low multiple (2-5x) of the number of cores on the server. If running in session mode, set it to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued. If not using connection pooling, set the parameter to the required number of concurrent users. Additionally, consider adjusting the 'max_connections' parameter to match or exceed the default value of typically 100 connections to allow queries on a standby server. This approach will help enhance performance and prevent suboptimal results."}
