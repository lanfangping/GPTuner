{'suggestion': "Adjust the 'vacuum_cost_delay' parameter in PostgreSQL based on the vacuum cost per page and workload requirements. For busy systems, consider reducing it to enhance background writer activity. Optimal values are typically in the range of 0 to 100 milliseconds, with multiples of 10ms being practical. Aim for values less than 1 millisecond for precise measurement on older platforms."}
