{'suggestion': "Adjust the 'default_statistics_target' knob in PostgreSQL based on the size of your tables. For medium-sized systems, values around 200 are suitable, while large systems may benefit from values of 500 or 1000. Understand the effects of raising this value on planner estimates and data analysis time to optimize system performance."}
