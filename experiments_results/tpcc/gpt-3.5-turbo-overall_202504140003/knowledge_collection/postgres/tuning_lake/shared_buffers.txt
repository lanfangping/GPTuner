{'suggestion': "For optimal performance in PostgreSQL, set the 'shared_buffers' parameter to 25% of the system's RAM. This recommendation is based on conventional wisdom and manual guidelines, which suggest allocating this amount of memory for shared memory buffers. It is particularly suitable for dedicated database servers with 1GB or more RAM, while smaller percentages are advisable for systems with less than 1GB of RAM."}
