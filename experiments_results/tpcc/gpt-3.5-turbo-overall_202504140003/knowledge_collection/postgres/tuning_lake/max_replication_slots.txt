{'suggestion': "Set the 'max_replication_slots' parameter to control the maximum number of replication slots in the server. Ensure the value is not lower than the existing replication slots to avoid server startup issues. Additionally, make sure that the 'wal_level' is set to replica or higher for the replication slots to function properly."}
