fsync
TUNING_SUGGESTION:
{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'fsync' knob in PostgreSQL is crucial for data durability, forcing updates to disk through fsync() calls. While enabling it ('fsync = on') is the default and recommended for ensuring data integrity, disabling it ('fsync = off') can enhance performance but at the risk of data corruption in the event of a system crash, making it suitable only for non-critical workloads. For those prioritizing performance without fully compromising on safety, adjusting 'synchronous_commit' provides a safer alternative for noncritical transactions. Additionally, tuning parameters like 'wal_writer_delay', 'commit_delay', and 'commit_siblings' can help manage write latency. It's important to keep 'full_page_writes = on' when 'fsync' is enabled to maintain data durability."}

TUNING_SUGGESTION:
{'suggestion': 'The `bgwriter_flush_after` parameter should be adjusted based on your specific workload and hardware configuration. For systems with light workloads or those using HDDs, a lower value like the default `64` is recommended to minimize I/O spikes. Conversely, for heavy write workloads or systems utilizing SSDs, increasing this value can help batch writes more efficiently and reduce fsync overhead. Additionally, this parameter forces the OS to write dirty data to storage after a certain amount of data (default is 512kB on Linux, 0 elsewhere) is written by the background writer, aiming to reduce checkpoint stalls and transaction latency. However, be aware that performance may degrade for workloads that fall between shared_buffers and the OS page cache.'}

autovacuum
TUNING_SUGGESTION:
{'suggestion': "To manage the 'autovacuum' knob in PostgreSQL effectively, ensure it is enabled (it is on by default, with 'track_counts' also needing to be enabled). The autovacuum launcher daemon can be disabled on a per-table basis, but it will still activate to prevent transaction ID wraparound, usually after about 2 billion transactions. For optimal performance, consider adjusting parameters such as 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' and 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' based on the specific needs of your database, especially for tables with high transaction volumes. Monitoring table statistics, like 'pg_stat_user_tables.n_dead_tup', can help in fine-tuning these settings."}

While a general guideline suggests configuring 2â€“4 workers per CPU core (e.g., 4â€“16 workers on a 4-core system), it's crucial to ensure that the total number of workers (`max_worker_processes`) accommodates other parallel operations.
