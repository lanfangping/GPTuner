Determine if 'wal_level' has any special values that alter its function significantly from its regular numerical order. 4. Confirm that 'wal_level' can be set to 'minimal', 'replica', or 'logical', where 'minimal' is a special value that significantly reduces the amount of information logged compared to other settings. 5. Conclude that 'wal_level' is a special knob due to the presence of the 'minimal' value which serves a distinct purpose.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "minimal"}
