{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'autovacuum_max_workers' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation, which is to specify the maximum number of autovacuum worker processes that can run simultaneously. 3. Check if this knob has any special values that deviate from its numerical ordering and perform a different function. 4. Discover that setting 'autovacuum_max_workers' to 0 disables the autovacuum feature entirely, which is a different function from its regular operation. 5. Conclude that 'autovacuum_max_workers' is a special knob because it has a special value (0) that changes its functionality.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "0"}
