{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'enable_seqscan' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular function, which is to enable or disable sequential scans in query planning. 3. Recognize that setting 'enable_seqscan' to 'off' (or 'false') changes its behavior significantly by disabling sequential scans, which is a special function compared to its regular operation. 4. Conclude that 'enable_seqscan' is a special knob because it has a special value ('off') that changes its behavior fundamentally.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "off"}
