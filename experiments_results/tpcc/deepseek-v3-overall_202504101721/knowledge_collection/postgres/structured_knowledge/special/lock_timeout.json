{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'lock_timeout' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation: it specifies the maximum amount of time a statement will wait for a lock before throwing an error. 3. Check if 'lock_timeout' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly. 4. Discover that setting 'lock_timeout' to 0 means the statement will not wait at all for a lock, which is a significant deviation from its regular operation. 5. Conclude that 'lock_timeout' is a special knob due to this special value.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
