{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL. 2. Research its function: it specifies a fraction of the table size to add to autovacuum_analyze_threshold when deciding whether to trigger an ANALYZE. 3. Determine if it has any special values that disable or significantly alter its function. 4. Find that it does not have such special values; it operates on a continuous scale where higher values mean more aggressive autovacuuming. 5. Conclude that it does not have special values that break the natural order.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
