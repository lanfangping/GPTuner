{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'transaction_isolation'. 2. Understand the normal operation of 'transaction_isolation' which sets the isolation level for transactions (e.g., 'read committed', 'serializable'). 3. Determine if 'transaction_isolation' has any special values that deviate from its normal operation. 4. Research or recall that 'transaction_isolation' does not have special values like -1 or 0 that disable or significantly alter its function; it only accepts standard isolation level values. 5. Conclude that 'transaction_isolation' is not a 'special knob' as it lacks special values that break its natural order or function.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
