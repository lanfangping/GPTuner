{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular function, which is to set the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples needed to trigger a VACUUM on a table. 3. Check if this knob has any special values that alter its behavior significantly, such as disabling the feature or triggering an immediate action regardless of the threshold. 4. Research PostgreSQL documentation or community knowledge to confirm if 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' has such special values. 5. Conclude based on findings whether it is a 'special knob' and identify any special values.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
