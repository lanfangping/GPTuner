{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'synchronous_commit' in PostgreSQL. 2. Research the functionality of 'synchronous_commit' to understand its normal operation and any special values it might have. 3. Determine if 'synchronous_commit' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly from its normal numerical operation. 4. Confirm that 'synchronous_commit' can be set to 'off' as a special value, which changes its behavior to not wait for the transaction to be written to disk before returning success to the client, unlike its normal operation where it waits. 5. Conclude that 'synchronous_commit' is a special knob due to this special value 'off' that changes its fundamental behavior.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "off"}
