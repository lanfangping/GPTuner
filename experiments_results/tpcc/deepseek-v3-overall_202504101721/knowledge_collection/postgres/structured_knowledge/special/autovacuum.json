{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'autovacuum'. 2. Research if 'autovacuum' has any special values that deviate from its normal numerical operation. 3. Determine if setting 'autovacuum' to a special value (like -1 or 0) changes its functionality significantly, such as disabling the feature. 4. Conclude whether 'autovacuum' fits the definition of a 'special knob' based on the findings.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "0"}
