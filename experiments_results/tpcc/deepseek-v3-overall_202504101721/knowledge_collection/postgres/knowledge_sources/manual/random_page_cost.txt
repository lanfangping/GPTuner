The `random_page_cost` parameter (default 4.0) estimates the cost of random disk page fetches, modeling them as 40x slower than sequential reads with a 90% cache-hit assumption, but can be adjusted (e.g., lowered to 1.1 for SSDs or raised for uncached workloads) to influence the planner's preference for index scans.
