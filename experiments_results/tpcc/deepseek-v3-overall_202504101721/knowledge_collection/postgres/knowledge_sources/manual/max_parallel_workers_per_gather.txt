The `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter sets the maximum number of parallel workers (default: 2, range: 0 to disable) a single Gather/Gather Merge node can use, with each worker consuming resources like an additional sessionâ€”e.g., 4 workers may use 5x more CPU, memory, and I/O than a non-parallel query.
