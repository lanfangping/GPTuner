The `wal_level` knob in PostgreSQL determines WAL logging detail with three levels: `minimal` (least data, no row info for certain operations), `replica` (default, supports archiving and replication), and `logical` (adds logical decoding info, increasing WAL volume, especially with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` and frequent UPDATE/DELETE operations). Prior to 9.6, `archive` and `hot_standby` were also valid but now map to `replica`. Minimal WAL cannot reconstruct data from backups alone.
