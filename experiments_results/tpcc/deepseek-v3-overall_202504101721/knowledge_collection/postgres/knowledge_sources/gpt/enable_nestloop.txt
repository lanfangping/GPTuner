To set the `enable_nestloop` knob in PostgreSQL, disable it (`enable_nestloop = off`) for large joins or complex queries where nested loop joins are inefficient (e.g., tables with >10,000 rows), but leave it on (`enable_nestloop = on`) for small tables or OLTP workloads where it improves performance (e.g., indexed lookups on tables with <1,000 rows). Adjust based on query planner benchmarks.
