To set the `enable_hashagg` knob in PostgreSQL, typically enable it (`on`) for large aggregations (e.g., >10,000 rows) to leverage hash-based performance gains, or disable it (`off`) for small datasets (e.g., <1,000 rows) to avoid overhead, with the default being `on`. Adjust based on query plans and memory constraints.
