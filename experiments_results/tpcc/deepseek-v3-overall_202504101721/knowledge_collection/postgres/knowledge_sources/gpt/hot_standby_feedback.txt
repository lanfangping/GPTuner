To set the `hot_standby_feedback` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (`on`) to reduce replication conflicts by allowing standbys to send feedback to the primary about query cancellations, typically leaving it disabled (`off`) if no conflicts are observed or setting a short delay (e.g., `hot_standby_feedback = on` with `max_standby_streaming_delay = 30s`) to balance between conflict prevention and primary bloat.
