To set `max_locks_per_transaction` in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on workload complexity: for typical OLTP systems, the default (64) suffices, but for high-concurrency or long transactions with many objects (e.g., 1000+ tables), increase it proportionally (e.g., 128–256) while ensuring `max_locks_per_transaction × max_connections` stays below the shared memory limit (default: 64 locks × 100 connections = 6400 locks). Monitor lock contention and OOM risks.
