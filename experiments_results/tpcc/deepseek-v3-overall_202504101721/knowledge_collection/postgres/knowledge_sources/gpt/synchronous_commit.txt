To set the `synchronous_commit` knob in PostgreSQL, choose:  
- **`on`** (default, safest, ensures durability with every commit),  
- **`off`** (risky, delays durability for performance),  
- **`remote_apply`** (waits for standby confirmation),  
- **`remote_write`** (waits for standby OS write), or  
- **`local`** (only local disk write).  

For example, set `off` for bulk loads (e.g., 10–100x faster) or `remote_apply` for HA (1–2 standby confirmations). Adjust based on RPO/RTO needs.
