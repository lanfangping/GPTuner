To set the `full_page_writes` knob in PostgreSQL, disable it (`off`) if you have a battery-backed RAID controller or a similar crash-safe filesystem (improving write performance), but leave it enabled (`on`, the default) if you lack such protections to prevent partial-page writes after crashes. For example, on systems with unsafe storage, keep it `on` (costing ~2x write overhead), while on crash-safe setups, set it `off` for ~20-30% faster writes. Always verify durability requirements first.
