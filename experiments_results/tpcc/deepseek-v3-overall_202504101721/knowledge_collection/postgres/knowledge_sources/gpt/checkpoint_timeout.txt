To set the `checkpoint_timeout` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on your workload and recovery needs: the default is 5 minutes (300 seconds), but increasing it to 15–30 minutes (900–1800 seconds) can reduce I/O overhead for write-heavy workloads, while shorter values (e.g., 1–5 minutes) may suit systems requiring faster crash recovery. Ensure it aligns with `max_wal_size` to avoid excessive WAL growth.  

*(Note: Always test changes in a staging environment and monitor performance.)*
