To set the `wal_buffers` knob in PostgreSQL, a common recommendation is to allocate **4MB (default)** or **1/32 of shared_buffers** (but not exceeding **16MB**), whichever is larger, with adjustments based on write-heavy workloads (e.g., up to **64MB** for high WAL activity).  

*(Example: If `shared_buffers` is 8GB, 1/32 would be 256MB, but cap at 16MB unless high WAL throughput justifies more.)*
