{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_seqscan' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of sequential scans, defaulting to 'on' to allow the planner to use sequential scans for small tables or when indexes are ineffective. However, it can be set to 'off' to discourage their use when alternative methods (e.g., index scans) are available, though they cannot be entirely suppressed. This adjustment is particularly recommended when query performance testing shows index scans are significantly faster (e.g., 2â€“10x improvement), such as in large-table queries where index scans can reduce execution time from 500ms to 50ms."}
