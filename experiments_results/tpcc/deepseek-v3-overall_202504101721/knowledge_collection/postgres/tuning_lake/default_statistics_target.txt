{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'default_statistics_target' knob in PostgreSQL should be set to a default value of **100** for table columns, unless overridden by ALTER TABLE. Higher values (e.g., **1000**) can improve query planner estimates but will slow down ANALYZE operations. For complex workloads, adjusting the value between **100 and 1000** may improve query planning accuracy, with higher values (e.g., **300-500**) recommended for such cases, though this increases ANALYZE time and storage. For OLTP systems or where planning overhead is a concern, lower values (**100-200**) are advisable."}
