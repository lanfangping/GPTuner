{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure the `shared_buffers` parameter in PostgreSQL effectively, it is recommended to allocate 25% of the system's available RAM for dedicated database servers, with a maximum of 40% of system memory for those with â‰¥1GB RAM to ensure optimal performance without excessively consuming OS resources. The default setting is 128MB, suitable for smaller systems or those with limited RAM. For systems with 32GB of RAM, allocating up to 8GB is advisable, especially for OLTP workloads, though starting with 1GB or 10% of RAM may be more appropriate for smaller setups. It's crucial to adjust based on the specific workload and validate the configuration through testing."}
