{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To set the 'max_connections' knob in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 100 concurrent database connections, ensuring it matches or exceeds the master server's value on a standby server to allow queries. For more precise tuning, consider allocating 100 connections as a baseline and then adding 5-20 connections per CPU core (e.g., 200–300 for a 16-core system), while ensuring sufficient RAM is available (approximately 10MB per connection for shared buffers). Adjust the number of connections based on the workload type—OLTP may require more connections, whereas OLAP may need fewer—and monitor the system for any signs of contention."}
