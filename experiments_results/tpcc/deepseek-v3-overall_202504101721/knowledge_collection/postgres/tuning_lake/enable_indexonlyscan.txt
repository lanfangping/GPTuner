{'suggestion': "The 'enable_indexonlyscan' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of index-only scans, which is enabled by default but requires 'enable_indexscan' to also be on for consideration. Enable it ('on') for queries that benefit from index-only scans, typically reducing I/O by 50-90% for suitable workloads, or disable it ('off') if sequential scans are more efficient, often when the visibility map is poorly maintained or indexes cover less than ~70% of the accessed columns. The exact performance gain depends on data distribution and query patterns; benchmark with 'EXPLAIN ANALYZE' to validate."}
