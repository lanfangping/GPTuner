{'suggestion': "The `synchronous_standby_names` parameter in PostgreSQL is used to specify a list of standby servers for synchronous replication, ensuring high availability and data protection. You can configure it to require transactions to wait for confirmation from either a specific number of prioritized standbys (priority-based) or any number of standbys (quorum-based) before committing. For example, use `'FIRST 3 (s1, s2, s3, s4)'` for priority-based replication requiring confirmation from the top 3 standbys, or `'ANY 3 (s1, s2, s3, s4)'` for quorum-based replication requiring confirmation from any 3 standbys. This setup ensures at least the specified number of synchronous standbys are used for stricter durability or basic high availability."}
