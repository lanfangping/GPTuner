{'suggestion': {'description': "The `bgwriter_lru_multiplier` in PostgreSQL controls the number of dirty buffers written per round by multiplying the average recent buffer demand by this value, with a default of 2.0. Higher values (like 2.0) favor proactive writes, while lower values (like 1.0) lean towards on-demand writes, balancing between proactive and on-demand writing strategies. Adjusting this parameter between 2.0 (default, moderate writeback) and higher values (4.0–8.0 for aggressive writeback in high-write workloads) can optimize performance, but it's crucial to monitor checkpoint and I/O load to prevent excessive disk contention. For read-heavy systems, lower values (1.0–2.0) may be more appropriate.", 'values': {'default': 2.0, 'proactive': 2.0, 'on_demand': 1.0, 'aggressive': '4.0–8.0', 'read_heavy': '1.0–2.0'}}}
