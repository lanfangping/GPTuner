{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_nestloop' parameter in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of nested-loop joins, defaulting to 'on' (enabled). It is recommended to disable it ('enable_nestloop = off') for large joins or complex queries where nested loop joins are inefficient, such as with tables containing more than 10,000 rows. However, it should remain enabled ('enable_nestloop = on') for small tables or OLTP workloads, particularly for indexed lookups on tables with fewer than 1,000 rows, where it can improve performance. Adjustments should be based on query planner benchmarks. When set to 'off,' the query planner is discouraged from using nested-loop joins unless no alternative join methods (e.g., hash or merge joins) are available."}
