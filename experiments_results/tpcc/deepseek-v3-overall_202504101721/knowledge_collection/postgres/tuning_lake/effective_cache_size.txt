{'suggestion': "The `effective_cache_size` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to influence the planner's decisions between index and sequential scans by estimating the available disk cache for a query. It is recommended to allocate this parameter based on the system's total RAM, specifically 50-75% of it, to reflect both the operating system's and PostgreSQL's expected cache utilization. This approach helps in optimizing query performance by accurately estimating how much data remains cached, considering that shared buffers and kernel cache are part of this estimation, and noting that this space is shared among concurrent queries without reserving actual memory."}
