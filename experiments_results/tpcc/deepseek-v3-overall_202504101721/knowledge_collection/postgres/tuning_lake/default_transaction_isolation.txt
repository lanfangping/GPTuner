{'suggestion': "To configure the 'default_transaction_isolation' in PostgreSQL, which determines the default isolation level for new SQL transactions, you can choose from the following options: 'read uncommitted' (least strict), 'read committed' (default), 'repeatable read', or 'serializable' (most strict). This setting can be adjusted either by modifying the 'postgresql.conf' file or by using the 'SET' command, for example, 'SET default_transaction_isolation = 'repeatable read';'. The available options and their implications are detailed in Chapter 13 of the PostgreSQL documentation and the SET TRANSACTION command."}
