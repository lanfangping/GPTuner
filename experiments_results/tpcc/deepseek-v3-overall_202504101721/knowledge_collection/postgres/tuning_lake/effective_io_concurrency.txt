{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure `effective_io_concurrency` in PostgreSQL, start with a value based on the number of drives in a RAID 0/1 array (excluding RAID 5 parity) for magnetic disks (e.g., 2–8), as this represents the number of concurrent disk I/O operations PostgreSQL can handle. For SSDs, consider higher values (e.g., 200–300) to leverage their capabilities. The default value is 1 if supported, otherwise 0. Adjustments should be made considering the workload parallelism and benchmark results, ensuring not to exceed 50% of your storage device's queue depth for optimal performance."}
