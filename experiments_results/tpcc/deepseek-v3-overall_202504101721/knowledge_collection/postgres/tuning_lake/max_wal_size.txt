{'suggestion': "To set `max_wal_size` in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to allocate a size that is at least twice the size of the largest transaction in your system to avoid frequent WAL checkpoints. The default setting is 1 GB, which serves as a soft limit for WAL growth during automatic checkpoints. This limit can be exceeded under heavy load or other special conditions, with higher values potentially increasing crash recovery time. A common practice is to set `max_wal_size` to 1GB per 1GB of `shared_buffers` (e.g., 8GB if `shared_buffers` is 8GB), ensuring it meets the minimum requirement based on your system's largest transaction size."}
