{'suggestion': "To configure the 'lock_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL, set a duration that aborts any statement waiting longer than the specified time to acquire a lock, with the duration interpreted as milliseconds if no units are provided (e.g., 5000 for 5 seconds). This setting applies separately to each lock attempt, whether explicit or implicit. For optimal performance, adjust the value based on your workload: consider starting with 100ms-300ms for OLTP systems to avoid long waits, 1s-10s for reporting queries, and 30s-5min or disable it (set to 0) for maintenance tasks, ensuring a balance between avoiding lock contention and allowing queries to complete."}
