{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_max_workers' parameter sets the maximum number of autovacuum worker processes (excluding the launcher) that can run concurrently, with a default value of 3, and it can only be configured at server startup. For optimal performance, allocate 1 worker per CPU core (up to 3-5 workers) for typical systems, but avoid exceeding half of available CPU cores or system memory limits (e.g., each worker needs ~100MB–1GB RAM). Adjust higher (e.g., 5–8 workers) for heavy-write workloads or many tables, but ensure total workers × 'autovacuum_work_mem' does not exhaust memory."}
