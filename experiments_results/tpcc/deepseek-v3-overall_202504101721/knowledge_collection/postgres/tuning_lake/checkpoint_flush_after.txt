{'suggestion': "The 'checkpoint_flush_after' setting should be configured to force the OS to write checkpoint data to storage after accumulating 256kB, which is the default on Linux (0 elsewhere), to reduce fsync stalls by limiting dirty page cache data. This approach is particularly beneficial for reducing I/O stalls on systems with slow storage. For systems with fast SSDs where the overhead might outweigh the benefits, consider adjusting the setting based on observed write latency and checkpoint performance, potentially starting with values between 512kB–1MB (e.g., 8192–16384 8kB pages) or disabling it altogether."}
