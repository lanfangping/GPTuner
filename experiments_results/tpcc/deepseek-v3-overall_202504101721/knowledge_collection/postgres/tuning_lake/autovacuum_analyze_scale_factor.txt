{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimize the 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to adjust it to a lower value such as 0.01 or 0.05 for more frequent ANALYZE operations on tables with smaller changes, while being mindful of the overhead. This parameter, which defaults to 0.1 (10% of table rows), can be fine-tuned in conjunction with 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold' (suggested range: 50–500 rows) for precise control. For instance, setting 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.01' will trigger ANALYZE after 1% of a table’s rows change, in addition to the threshold. This adjustment can be made globally in postgresql.conf or specified per-table through storage parameters."}
