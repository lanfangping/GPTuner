{'suggestion': "To configure the `max_locks_per_transaction` parameter in PostgreSQL, it's essential to understand that it determines the average number of object locks (such as tables) allocated per transaction, with a default value of 64. For standby servers, it's crucial to set this value to match or exceed the master's setting to ensure query execution. While the default setting is adequate for typical OLTP systems, scenarios involving high-concurrency or transactions that interact with a large number of objects (e.g., over 1000 tables) may necessitate an increase in this value (e.g., to 128â€“256) to accommodate the workload complexity. It's also important to monitor for potential lock contention and the risk of out-of-memory (OOM) issues when adjusting this parameter."}
