{'suggestion': 'The `bgwriter_flush_after` parameter should be adjusted based on your specific workload and hardware configuration. For systems with light workloads or those using HDDs, a lower value like the default `64` is recommended to minimize I/O spikes. Conversely, for heavy write workloads or systems utilizing SSDs, increasing this value can help batch writes more efficiently and reduce fsync overhead. Additionally, this parameter forces the OS to write dirty data to storage after a certain amount of data (default is 512kB on Linux, 0 elsewhere) is written by the background writer, aiming to reduce checkpoint stalls and transaction latency. However, be aware that performance may degrade for workloads that fall between shared_buffers and the OS page cache.'}
