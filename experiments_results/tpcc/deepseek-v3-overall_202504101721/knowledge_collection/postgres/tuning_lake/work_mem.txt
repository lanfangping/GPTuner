{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `work_mem` knob in PostgreSQL sets the base maximum memory limit for query operations such as sorts or hash tables before spilling to disk, with a default of 4MB. For optimal performance, allocate **4MB–16MB per operation** for OLTP workloads and **64MB–256MB** for analytical queries. It's important to ensure that the total memory usage (`work_mem × max_worker_processes × max_connections`) does not exceed **25% of system RAM** to avoid OOM errors. Adjustments should be made based on query complexity and available system resources. Note that hash-based operations may use more memory via `hash_mem_multiplier`, and multiple concurrent operations or sessions can increase total memory usage beyond the set `work_mem` value."}
