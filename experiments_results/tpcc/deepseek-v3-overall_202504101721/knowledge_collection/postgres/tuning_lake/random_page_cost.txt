{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `random_page_cost` parameter in PostgreSQL, with a default value of 4.0, estimates the cost of random disk page fetches by modeling them as 40x slower than sequential reads under a 90% cache-hit assumption. For SSDs, it is recommended to lower this value to around 1.1â€“1.5 to better reflect their performance characteristics. In cases of in-memory databases or very fast NVMe drives, a value of 1.0 may be appropriate. Adjusting this parameter can influence the planner's preference for index scans, and it's advisable to benchmark with your specific workload to fine-tune the setting."}
