{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' parameter determines the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples needed to initiate a VACUUM operation on a table, with a default value of 50. This setting can be adjusted globally in postgresql.conf or specified per-table using storage parameters. For optimal performance, consider adjusting the threshold higher (e.g., 100–500) for large tables to decrease vacuum frequency, or lower (e.g., 20–30) for small, frequently updated tables to ensure timely cleanup."}
