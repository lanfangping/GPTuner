{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' parameter is used to determine when to trigger a VACUUM operation by adding a specified percentage of a table's size to 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold'. The default value is 0.2 (20%), but this can be adjusted per table based on its activity level. For highly active tables, consider setting a lower value (e.g., 0.01â€“0.05) to trigger vacuums more frequently, while the default value may suffice for stable tables. Adjustments can be made via storage parameters, and it's important to monitor table bloat and performance to refine the value. Example: `ALTER TABLE my_table SET (autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.02);` sets a 2% threshold for 'my_table'."}
