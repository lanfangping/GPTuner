{'suggestion': "The 'checkpoint_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL sets the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints, with a default value of 5 minutes (300 seconds). Adjusting this value should be based on your workload and recovery needs: longer intervals (e.g., 15–30 minutes or 900–1800 seconds) can reduce I/O overhead for write-heavy workloads, while shorter values (e.g., 1–5 minutes) may suit systems requiring faster crash recovery. It's crucial to ensure that the setting aligns with 'max_wal_size' to avoid excessive WAL growth. Always test changes in a staging environment and monitor performance to find the optimal setting for your specific scenario."}
