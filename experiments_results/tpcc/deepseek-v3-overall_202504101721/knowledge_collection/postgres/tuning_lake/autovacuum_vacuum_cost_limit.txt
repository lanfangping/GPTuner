{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' parameter should be adjusted from its default setting to allow autovacuum operations to work more efficiently. The default value is -1, which defers to 'vacuum_cost_limit'. When setting this parameter, consider distributing the value proportionally among workers (e.g., a limit of 200 split between 2 workers becomes 100 each). For more aggressive autovacuum operations, increasing the value to between 1000–2000 (or higher for high-performance SSDs, up to 2000–8000) is recommended, while balancing with 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' (e.g., 2ms) to prevent overwhelming I/O. It's crucial to monitor system load and adjust based on vacuum performance and disk latency, as exact values depend on the specific workload and hardware."}
