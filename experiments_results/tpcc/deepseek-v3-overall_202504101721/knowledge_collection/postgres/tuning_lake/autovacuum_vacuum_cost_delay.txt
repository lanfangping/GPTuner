{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' parameter controls the cost delay for autovacuum operations with a default value of 2ms in PostgreSQL 13+. This setting can be adjusted based on the specific workload: use 2ms for aggressive vacuuming in high-churn OLTP environments, 10–20ms for a balanced approach, or 50–100ms for conservative tuning to minimize I/O impact. Additionally, this parameter can be overridden on a per-table basis using storage parameters. It's important to monitor table bloat and autovacuum runtime to fine-tune the setting. Note that versions prior to PostgreSQL 13 default to 20ms."}
