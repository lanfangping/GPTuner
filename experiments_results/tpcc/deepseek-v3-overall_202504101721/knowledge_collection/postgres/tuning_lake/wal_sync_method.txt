{'comprehensive_suggestion': "For the `wal_sync_method` knob in PostgreSQL, it controls how WAL updates are forced to disk with options such as `fdatasync` (default on Linux/FreeBSD, safe), `fsync`, `fsync_writethrough` (suitable for battery-backed write cache), `open_datasync`, and `open_sync` (faster but riskier on crashes). The choice impacts both crash safety and performance. While the default setting may not be optimal for all systems, it's recommended to select a method based on your OS and hardware specifics, considering the balance between durability and performance. Benchmarking with concrete numbers, like `fsync` latency (e.g., <5ms for HDDs, <1ms for SSDs), can help in making an informed decision."}
