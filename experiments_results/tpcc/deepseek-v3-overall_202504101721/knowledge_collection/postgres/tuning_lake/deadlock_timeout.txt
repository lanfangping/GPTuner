{'suggestion': 'To set the `deadlock_timeout` in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to use a wait time that exceeds typical transaction times to balance between detection speed and system overhead. The default setting is 1000ms (1 second), which is suitable for many scenarios. However, for OLTP systems, a range of 1-2 seconds (1000-2000ms) is commonly recommended to balance deadlock detection overhead with user experience. In cases of batch workloads or heavily loaded servers, adjusting the timeout higher (e.g., 5-10s) may be beneficial to reduce false positives. It is crucial to test any adjustments under realistic load conditions to ensure optimal performance.'}
