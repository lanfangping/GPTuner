{"think_procedure": "1. Understand the definition of a 'special knob': A numerical knob with specific values (e.g., -1, 0) that cause it to perform a very different function (e.g., disable a feature) compared to its regular numerical operation, breaking the natural order.\n2. Research the specified PostgreSQL knob: 'autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age'.\n3. Consult the official PostgreSQL documentation for 'autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age' to determine its purpose, allowed range of values, default value, and any documented special meanings for particular values.\n   - Purpose: Specifies the maximum age (in multixactions) that a table's pg_class.relminmxid can attain before an AUTOVACUUM operation is forced to prevent multixaction ID wraparound.\n   - Default value: 400,000,000.\n   - Allowed range: Minimum 10,000,000, maximum 2,000,000,000.\n4. Analyze if the knob meets the criteria for a 'special knob':\n   - Check for special values like -1 or 0 that trigger a distinct behavior. The documentation for 'autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age' does not mention any such values. Values like 0 or -1 are not within the permitted range (minimum is 10,000,000).\n   - The knob functions as a threshold. Changing its value within the allowed range adjusts how aggressively the anti-wraparound vacuum operates, but it does not fundamentally alter the nature of the operation or disable it based on a specific flag-like value.\n5. Conclude: 'autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age' does not exhibit the characteristics of a 'special knob' as defined. It's a standard numerical setting that operates consistently as a threshold across its valid range.\n6. Determine the JSON output values based on the conclusion.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
