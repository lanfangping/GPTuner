{"think_procedure": ["1. Understand the knob `synchronous_commit` and its purpose in PostgreSQL. It controls when a transaction commit is reported as successful to the client, based on WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) processing.", "2. Consult the PostgreSQL documentation for the possible values of `synchronous_commit`. The documented values are: `on` (or `true`), `off` (or `false`), `local`, `remote_write`, and `remote_apply`.", "3. Analyze these values against the definition of a 'special numerical knob': a knob that typically has a natural order, but has special values (like -1 or 0) that break this order and cause a very different function, such as disabling a feature.", "4. While `synchronous_commit` is an enumerated type rather than a simple integer, its values represent different levels of durability guarantees and performance trade-offs, which can be seen as an ordered scale of safety.", "5. The 'regular operation' for `synchronous_commit` involves waiting for WAL records to be written to disk (and potentially replicated) to some extent before acknowledging the commit. This is true for `on`, `local`, `remote_write`, and `remote_apply`, which offer varying degrees of this waiting/synchronization.", "6. The value `off` (or its boolean equivalent `false`) instructs the server to report success as soon as the transaction is logically complete, without waiting for WAL to be flushed to disk. This significantly changes the behavior by disabling the synchronous aspect of the commit, prioritizing performance over immediate durability and risking data loss in case of a server crash.", "7. This 'disabling' of the synchronous wait mechanism aligns with the description of a special value causing the knob to perform a 'very different function' or 'disabling a feature'.", "8. The other values (`on`, `local`, `remote_write`, `remote_apply`) represent different strengths or modes of the synchronous commit feature, whereas `off` effectively turns this feature off.", "9. Therefore, `synchronous_commit` can be classified as a 'special knob' because the value `off` makes it behave in a fundamentally different way compared to its other settings.", "10. The special value is `off`."], "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
