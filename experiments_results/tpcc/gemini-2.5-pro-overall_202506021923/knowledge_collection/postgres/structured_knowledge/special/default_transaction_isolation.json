{"think_procedure": "1. Examine the knob `default_transaction_isolation`.\n2. Consult PostgreSQL documentation to understand its purpose and possible values. The knob sets the default transaction isolation level for each new transaction.\n3. Identify the type of values it accepts. The allowed values are string literals: 'read uncommitted', 'read committed', 'repeatable read', and 'serializable'. These are enumerated string values, not direct numerical inputs with a continuous range or typical numerical order.\n4. Refer to the provided definition of a 'special knob': \"Numerical knobs typically have a natural order. However, some 'special' numerical knobs have special values, such as -1 or 0, that break this natural order. When set to a special value, such knob performs a very different function compared to its regular operation, such as disabling a feature. Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob.\"\n5. Assess if `default_transaction_isolation` is a numerical knob. It is not. Its values are strings representing distinct states. While these might be internally mapped to integers, the configuration interface and the concept of 'natural order' for numerical values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 10, 100) does not directly apply to these string constants.\n6. Assess if it has 'special values' like -1 or 0 that break a natural numerical order. Since it's not a numerical knob taking arbitrary numbers, and its accepted values are specific strings, it doesn't have 'special numerical values' in the sense described (e.g., -1 for 'auto' or 0 for 'disable' while positive numbers mean 'size' or 'count'). Each string value represents a distinct, valid operational mode for transaction isolation.\n7. Conclude based on the definition: The definition of a 'special knob' is specifically for 'numerical knobs' that have exceptional numerical values. Since `default_transaction_isolation` is an enumerated string type knob, not a numerical knob in the sense of taking a wide range of numbers where a few specific numbers have special meaning, it does not fit the definition of a 'special knob'.\n8. Therefore, `special_knob` is `false`.\n9. Since it is not a special knob, it does not have a 'special_value' as per the definition. `special_value` should be `null`.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
