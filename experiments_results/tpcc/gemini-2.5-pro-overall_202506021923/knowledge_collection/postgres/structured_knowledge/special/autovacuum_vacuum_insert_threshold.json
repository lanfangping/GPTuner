{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob: `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold`.\n2. Consult the PostgreSQL documentation for this specific knob.\n3. Look for documented special values that change the knob's behavior from a simple numerical scale to a distinct mode of operation (e.g., disabling a feature).\n4. The PostgreSQL documentation for `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` states: 'Specifies the number of inserted tuples needed to trigger a VACUUM in any one table. The default is -1, meaning no insert-driven VACUUMs will be triggered based on this setting.'\n5. This description indicates that the value -1 has a special meaning: it disables the insert-driven vacuum trigger based on this threshold.\n6. If the value were, for example, 1000, it would mean that an autovacuum VACUUM is triggered after 1000 inserts (in conjunction with `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor`).\n7. The behavior at -1 (feature disabled for this specific threshold) is qualitatively different from its behavior at positive integer values (feature enabled with a specific numeric threshold).\n8. Therefore, `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` is classified as a special knob.\n9. The special value identified is -1.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
