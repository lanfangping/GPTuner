{"think_procedure": "1. **Understand the Knob's Purpose:** The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` knob in PostgreSQL specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) that the autovacuum process will sleep when it has exceeded its cost limit. \n2. **Consult Official Documentation:** Check the PostgreSQL documentation for `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay`. The documentation states: 'Specifies the cost delay value that will be used in autovacuum operations. If -1 is specified, the regular vacuum_cost_delay value will be used. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. The default value is 2 milliseconds.' \n3. **Identify Potential Special Values:** The documentation explicitly mentions `-1` as having a distinct behavior. \n4. **Analyze against 'Special Knob' Definition:** \n    a. **Natural Order:** Positive values (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 10, 20 ms) represent a duration, and there's a natural order (longer delay for larger positive values). \n    b. **Breaks Natural Order / Different Function:** The value `-1` does not represent a delay duration in the same way. Instead, it signifies that the system should use the value of a different knob (`vacuum_cost_delay`). This is a redirection of configuration, a behavior fundamentally different from directly setting a delay value. \n    c. **Comparison to 'Disabling a Feature':** While not strictly disabling a feature, using `-1` changes the *source* of the configuration for this specific delay, which is a significant functional difference from its regular operation of directly specifying the delay. \n5. **Conclusion:** The knob `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` is a 'special knob' because the value `-1` causes it to behave differently by deferring to another configuration parameter, rather than directly setting the delay. \n6. **Determine Special Value:** The special value identified is `-1`.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
