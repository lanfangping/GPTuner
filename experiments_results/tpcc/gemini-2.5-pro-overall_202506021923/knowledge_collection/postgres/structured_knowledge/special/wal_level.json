Understand the definition of a 'special knob' from the problem description: It's a numerical knob with special values (e.g., -1, 0) that deviate from its natural numerical order to perform a distinctly different function, such as disabling a feature. For other values, it behaves as a standard numerical knob.", "2. Retrieve information about the PostgreSQL knob `wal_level`.", "3. Check the data type of `wal_level`. PostgreSQL documentation specifies `wal_level` as an enumerated type (enum). Its valid values are string literals: `minimal`, `replica`, and `logical`.", "4. Evaluate if `wal_level` meets the primary criterion of being a 'numerical knob'. Since `wal_level` is an enum with string values, it is not a numerical knob.", "5. Conclude based on the definition: As `wal_level` is not a numerical knob, it cannot be classified as a 'special knob' according to the provided definition.", "6. Therefore, `special_knob` is false, and `special_value` is not applicable (set to null)."], "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
