{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob: `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`.\n2. Understand its general purpose: This knob is a numerical setting in PostgreSQL. It specifies the base minimum number of updated or deleted tuples in a table that must be present before an autovacuum process will consider that table for a `VACUUM` operation. It is part of the formula: `vacuum_trigger_point = autovacuum_vacuum_threshold + autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor * number_of_tuples`.\n3. Examine behavior with potential special values (e.g., -1, 0) in different contexts:\n    a. Global context (`postgresql.conf`): The minimum allowed value for `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` is 0. A value of 0 means the fixed part of the vacuum threshold is zero. This is an extreme of its normal numerical behavior (a very low threshold), not a change in its fundamental function (like disabling a feature or changing operational mode). A value of -1 is not allowed globally as it's below the minimum of 0.\n    b. Per-table storage parameter context (`ALTER TABLE ... SET (autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = <value>)`): PostgreSQL documentation for `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE` (Storage Parameters section) states that for `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` set at the table level, a value of -1 can be specified. This value of -1 instructs PostgreSQL to use the global `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` setting for that table, effectively unsetting or overriding any table-specific numerical threshold with a directive to use the global default.\n4. Evaluate against the definition of a 'special knob': A special knob has values (like -1 or 0) that break the natural numerical order and cause the knob to perform a very different function. In the per-table context, setting `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` to -1 does exactly this: -1 is not interpreted as a tuple count, and its function changes from 'setting a specific threshold' to 'deferring to the global configuration'.\n5. Conclusion: Based on its behavior with the value -1 in the context of per-table storage parameters, `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` is classified as a special knob.\n6.
