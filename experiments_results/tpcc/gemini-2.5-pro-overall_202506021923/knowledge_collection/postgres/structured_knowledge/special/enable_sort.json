Compare `enable_sort` against this definition:", "   a. `enable_sort` is `boolean`, not primarily a 'numerical knob' in the sense of taking a wide range of numbers (e.g., sizes, counts, percentages). The definition emphasizes 'numerical knobs'.", "   b. As a boolean, its 'natural order' (if 0 for false and 1 for true are considered) is minimal and doesn't fit the context of a broader numerical range that can be 'broken' by a special value.", "   c. The values are `true` and `false`. If `false` (or its numerical representation 0) were considered 'special' because it disables the feature (explicit sorts), this is inherent to its nature as a boolean toggle, rather than an exceptional value in a wider numerical range.", "   d. `false` (disabling explicit sorts) does lead to a different function compared to `true` (enabling them).", "   e. Critically, `enable_sort` does not 'otherwise behave like a regular numerical knob' because it only has two states (`true`/`false`). It doesn't accept a range of other numerical values where its behavior would be modulated quantitatively, which is implied for a 'regular numerical knob'.", "5. Conclusion: `enable_sort` does not meet the criteria for a 'special numerical knob', primarily because it is a boolean knob and does not possess a range of numerical operations from which a specific value deviates to become 'special'. Its two states define its entire operational scope."], "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
