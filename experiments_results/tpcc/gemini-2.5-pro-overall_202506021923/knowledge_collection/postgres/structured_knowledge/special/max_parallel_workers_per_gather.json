{"think_procedure": "1. Understand the knob's purpose: `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` in PostgreSQL sets the maximum number of parallel worker processes that a single Gather or Gather Merge node can start.\n2. Consult PostgreSQL documentation for its range, default, and behavior at specific values. The documentation states its minimum value is 0, and its default is 2.\n3. Analyze the behavior at the minimum value (0). The PostgreSQL documentation explicitly states: 'Setting this value to 0 disables parallel query execution.'\n4. Compare this behavior to its behavior with positive values. Positive values (e.g., 1, 2, ...) set an upper limit on the number of workers for a gather operation, enabling the feature up to that limit.\n5. The value 0 fundamentally changes the operation from 'limit the number of workers for parallel execution' to 'disable parallel query execution'. This is a distinct functional change, not merely the lower end of a quantitative scale (e.g., 'use zero workers but parallelism is still conceptually on'). Disabling a feature (parallel query execution) at a specific numerical value (0) qualifies it as a special value according to the provided definition.\n6. Therefore, `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` is a special knob, and 0 is its special value.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
