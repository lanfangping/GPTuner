{"think_procedure": "1. **Analyze the knob's type**: `enable_tidscan` is a boolean knob in PostgreSQL. Its valid values are `on` (true) and `off` (false).\n2. **Evaluate against the 'numerical knob' criterion**: The definition of a 'special knob' starts with 'Numerical knobs typically have a natural order.' Since `enable_tidscan` is boolean, not numerical (in the sense of a continuous or discrete numerical range like counts, sizes, or durations), it does not meet this primary characteristic.\n3. **Evaluate against the 'special values breaking natural order' criterion**: The definition states that special numerical knobs have 'special values, such as -1 or 0, that break this natural order.' Boolean knobs do not have a 'natural order' of numerical values that can be broken in this way. The values `true` and `false` represent the complete set of expected states for a boolean, not a numerical range with exceptional values.\n4. **Consider the 'disabling a feature' aspect**: The definition mentions that a special value might cause the knob to perform a 'very different function compared to its regular operation, such as disabling a feature.' For `enable_tidscan`, setting it to `off` disables the TID scan feature. While this matches the *effect* part of the definition, the preceding conditions (being a numerical knob with special numerical values breaking natural order) are not met. The disabling function of `off` is a standard, inherent behavior of a boolean toggle, not an exceptional case for a numerical range.\n5. **Conclusion**: Because `enable_tidscan` is a boolean knob and not a numerical knob with special out-of-range or boundary numerical values that alter its behavior, it does not fit the provided definition of a 'special knob.' Therefore, it is classified as not special in this context.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
