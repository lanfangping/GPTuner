{"think_procedure": "1. **Understand the Knob's Purpose:** Identify what `pg_stat_statements.max` controls. It controls the maximum number of statements tracked by the `pg_stat_statements` module.\n2. **Understand \"Special Knob\" Definition:** Recall that a special knob has specific numerical values (like 0 or -1) that trigger a behavior fundamentally different from its normal graded numerical effect (e.g., disabling a feature).\n3. **Check Knob's Data Type and Range:** `pg_stat_statements.max` is an integer. Its documented default is 5000. The PostgreSQL source code (and documentation implicitly by allowing a minimum) indicates its minimum configurable value is 0.\n4. **Analyze the Behavior at Potential Special Values (e.g., 0):** \n   - If `pg_stat_statements.max` is set to a positive integer `N` (e.g., 1, 100, 5000), it tracks up to `N` statements. This is its regular numerical behavior where the capacity scales with the value.\n   - Consider `pg_stat_statements.max = 0`. Logically, tracking a 'maximum of 0 statements' implies that no statements can be tracked.\n5. **Consult Documentation and Source Code for Confirmation:**\n   - The PostgreSQL documentation for `pg_stat_statements.max` states its purpose but doesn't explicitly highlight 0 as a special disabling value in its main description, though it notes the minimum configurable value is 0.\n   - Examining the PostgreSQL source code for `pg_stat_statements.c` provides definitive confirmation. The internal variable `pgss_max` corresponds to this GUC. In the `pgss_alloc()` function, which is responsible for allocating an entry for a new statement to be tracked, there is an explicit check: `if (pgss_max == 0) return NULL;`. \n   - A comment directly preceding this check in the source code states: `/* pgss_max can be zero, effectively disabling statement tracking. ... */`.\n6. **Compare Behavior with \"Special Knob\" Definition:**\n   - Regular behavior (when `pg_stat_statements.max > 0`): Track up to `N` statements. The module is active and its capacity is determined by the knob's value.\n   - Behavior at `pg_stat_statements.max = 0`: No new statements are allocated or tracked. The core functionality of `pg_stat_statements` is effectively disabled.\n   - This change from 'tracking N statements' to 'tracking no statements / feature disabled' is a qualitative shift in behavior, not just a quantitative one. This fits the definition of a special knob where the special value `0` disables the feature.\n7. **Determine if it's a Special Knob and Identify Special Value(s):**\n   - Based on the source code and the resulting behavior, `pg_stat_statements.max` is a special knob.\n   - The special value that triggers this distinct behavior is `0`.\n8. **Formulate the JSON Output:** Construct the JSON object with the thinking procedure, `special_knob` flag set to true, and `special_value` set to 0.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
