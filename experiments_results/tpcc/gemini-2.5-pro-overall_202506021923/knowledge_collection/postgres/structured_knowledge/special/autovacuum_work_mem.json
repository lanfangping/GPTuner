Analyze the behavior of 'autovacuum_work_mem' at potential special values:", "   - If 'autovacuum_work_mem' is set to -1 (the default): It means the autovacuum worker will use the value of 'maintenance_work_mem'. This is a redirection or an alternative configuration source, not a direct memory value in the typical sense of the knob.", "   - If 'autovacuum_work_mem' is set to a positive value (e.g., 64MB, 128MB): It directly specifies the memory for autovacuum workers. These values follow a natural order (more memory).", "5. Evaluate if -1 breaks the natural order and signifies a special function:", "   - The value -1 does not fit into the natural order of memory sizes (e.g., 0KB, 1KB, ...).
