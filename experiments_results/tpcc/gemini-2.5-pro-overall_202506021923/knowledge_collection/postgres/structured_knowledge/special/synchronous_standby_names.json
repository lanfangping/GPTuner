{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob: The knob is `synchronous_standby_names`.\n2. Determine its data type: According to PostgreSQL documentation, `synchronous_standby_names` is a string type.\n3. Understand the definition of a 'special knob': A knob is special if it has specific values that make it perform a very different function compared to its regular operation, often disabling a feature or changing its mode fundamentally. The prompt gives numerical knobs with -1 or 0 as examples, but the core idea is the distinct operational mode triggered by a special value.\n4. Analyze the behavior of `synchronous_standby_names`:\n   a. Its primary purpose is to specify standby servers for synchronous replication.\n   b. If set to an empty string (`''`), synchronous replication is disabled. The documentation states: 'If this parameter is an empty string, then synchronous replication is not enabled and commits will not wait for replication.'\n   c. If set to a non-empty string (e.g., a list of server names, `*`, or `ANY num_sync (name1, ...)` syntax), synchronous replication is enabled and configured according to the string's content.\n5. Compare with the 'special knob' definition:\n   a. The empty string (`''`) causes `synchronous_standby_names` to perform a 'very different function' (disabling synchronous replication) compared to its regular operation (configuring and enabling synchronous replication).\n   b. This aligns with the characteristic 'such as disabling a feature.'\n6. Conclusion on 'special_knob': `synchronous_standby_names` can be considered a special knob because the empty string acts as a special value that fundamentally changes its behavior.\n7. Identify 'special_value': The special value is the empty string (`''`).", "special_knob": true, "special_value": ""}
