{"think_procedure": ["1. Understand the definition of a 'special knob': A 'special knob' is a numerical knob that typically has a natural order. It has 'special values' (e.g., -1 or 0) that break this natural order and cause the knob to perform a very different function (e.g., disabling a feature) compared to its regular numerical operation. Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob.", "2. Identify the PostgreSQL knob to classify: `transaction_isolation`.", "3. Determine the type and allowed values for `transaction_isolation`.", "   - According to PostgreSQL documentation, `transaction_isolation` accepts string values: 'serializable', 'repeatable read', 'read committed', and 'read uncommitted'.", "4. Assess if `transaction_isolation` is a numerical knob.", "   - No, `transaction_isolation` is not a numerical knob. Its values are predefined strings representing different isolation levels. It is an enumerated type.", "5. Apply the definition of 'special knob' to `transaction_isolation`.", "   - The definition explicitly states that a 'special knob' is a 'numerical knob'.", "   - Since `transaction_isolation` is not a numerical knob, it does not meet the primary criterion of the definition.", "   - Consequently, it cannot have 'special numerical values' like -1 or 0 that break a natural numerical order, because it doesn't operate on a numerical scale in the first place.", "6. Conclude the classification.", "   - `transaction_isolation` is not a 'special knob' according to the provided definition.", "7. Determine the 'special_value'.", "   - Since it is not a special knob, it does not have a special value in the context of the definition. Therefore, this should be `null` or not applicable."], "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
