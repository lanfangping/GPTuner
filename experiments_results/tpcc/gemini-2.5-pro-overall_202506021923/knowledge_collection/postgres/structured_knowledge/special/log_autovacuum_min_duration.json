{"think_procedure": "1. Understand the knob's purpose: `log_autovacuum_min_duration` is a PostgreSQL configuration parameter that controls the logging of autovacuum actions based on their execution duration.\n2. Consult official documentation: Review the PostgreSQL documentation for `log_autovacuum_min_duration` to understand how different values affect its behavior.\n3. Identify behavior for specific values:\n    - According to the documentation, if `log_autovacuum_min_duration` is set to `-1` (the default), logging of autovacuum actions is disabled.\n    - If set to `0`, all autovacuum actions are logged, regardless of their duration.\n    - If set to a positive integer `N`, autovacuum actions that run for at least `N` milliseconds are logged. This represents the 'regular' numerical behavior where the knob acts as a threshold.\n4. Analyze for 'special' characteristics: A 'special' numerical knob has values (e.g., -1, 0) that make it perform a very different function compared to its regular operation.\n    - The value `-1` (disabling logging) is a distinct function, different from setting a duration threshold.\n    - The value `0` (logging all actions) is also a distinct function, different from selectively logging based on a duration threshold.\n5. Determine if the knob is special: Since the values `-1` and `0` cause `log_autovacuum_min_duration` to behave in a way that is fundamentally different from its role as a simple numerical threshold (e.g., disabling the feature or changing its mode to 'log all'), it qualifies as a special knob.\n6. Identify the special value: Both -1 and 0 are special values. The value `-1` is particularly representative as it disables the feature, which is a common characteristic of special values. For the purpose of providing a single special value as requested, `-1` is chosen.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
