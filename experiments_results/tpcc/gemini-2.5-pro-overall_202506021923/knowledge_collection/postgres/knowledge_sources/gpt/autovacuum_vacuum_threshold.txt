Set `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` to a base number of dead tuples (defaulting to 50) that must accumulate before autovacuum considers running on a table; for very active, large tables, this might be increased to values like 500-5000 (or even higher on a per-table basis) especially when `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` is also significantly reduced to make vacuuming more responsive to the percentage of dead rows.
