Set `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` to a specific number of inserted rows, for example, between 1,000 and 50,000 (defaulting to -1, which disables it), to trigger an `ANALYZE` (not `VACUUM`) on that table, primarily for insert-heavy tables requiring more frequent statistic updates than the main `autovacuum_analyze_threshold` would provide.
