Set `min_wal_size` higher than its default (e.g., 80MB) to a value like **256MB-1GB** for light to moderate workloads, or **2GB-8GB+** for busy systems with replication or significant archiving lag, to ensure sufficient WAL is retained for standby catch-up and to smooth out disk space usage by preventing excessive WAL file recycling after checkpoints, keeping it comfortably below `max_wal_size`.
