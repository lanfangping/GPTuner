Set `commit_siblings` to a value, typically the default of 5, representing the minimum number of other concurrent transactions that must also be ready to commit before the current transaction flushes WAL, potentially increasing it (e.g., to 10-50) on systems with very high concurrent commit activity (hundreds of connections) to improve throughput by batching these flushes.
