Set `synchronous_standby_names` to a string specifying the number of synchronous replicas required (e.g., `1` or `2`) and a list of their `application_name`s, such as `ANY 1 (standby_a, standby_b)` to wait for any one of the two listed standbys, or `FIRST 1 (primary_standby, secondary_standby)` to wait for the first available from a prioritised list of two.
