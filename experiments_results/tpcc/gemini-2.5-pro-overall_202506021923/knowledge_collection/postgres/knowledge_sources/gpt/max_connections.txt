Set `max_connections` to a value slightly higher than the anticipated peak number of *simultaneously active* connections required by your applications or connection pooler, typically ranging from a few dozen to a few hundred (e.g., 100-300 for many systems), ensuring the server has sufficient RAM as each connection consumes several megabytes.
