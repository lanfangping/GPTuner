If overriding its default (-1, which uses `maintenance_work_mem`), set `autovacuum_work_mem` to a value—typically starting between 64MB and 256MB, potentially increasing up to 1GB or even 2GB for very large, frequently updated tables—sufficient for a single worker to hold all dead tuple identifiers from its largest target table in memory for one pass, while ensuring the total (`autovacuum_work_mem` * `autovacuum_max_workers`) doesn't excessively consume available system RAM.
