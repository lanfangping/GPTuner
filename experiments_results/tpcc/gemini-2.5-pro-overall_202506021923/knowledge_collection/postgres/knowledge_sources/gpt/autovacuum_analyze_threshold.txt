Set `autovacuum_analyze_threshold` to the minimum number of row inserts, updates, or deletes (default 50) that must occur on a table before an ANALYZE is triggered, a value primarily adjusted downwards for smaller or very volatile tables to ensure more frequent statistic updates where this base threshold is more impactful than the additional `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` (default 10% of table size).
