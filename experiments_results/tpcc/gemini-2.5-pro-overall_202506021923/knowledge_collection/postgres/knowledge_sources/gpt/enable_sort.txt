Set `enable_sort` to `ON` (the default, often represented as 1) to allow the planner to consider sort operations, and only change it to `OFF` (0) as a last resort if the planner consistently chooses suboptimal sort-based plans even when `work_mem` is sufficiently large (e.g., many megabytes or gigabytes depending on workload).
