The `wal_level` parameter dictates Write-Ahead Log (WAL) verbosity across three distinct levels: `minimal` for basic crash recovery, `replica` (default) supporting WAL archiving and replication (as used since PostgreSQL 9.6, replacing older `archive` and `hot_standby`), and `logical` adding information for logical decoding, with each level cumulatively including data from lower levels.
