SENTENCE:
`max_parallel_workers_per_gather` sets the maximum number of workers (default 2, with 0 disabling parallel queries) that a single Gather or Gather Merge node can use, noting that increasing this can substantially multiply resource consumption, for example, 4 workers might use up to 5 times the CPU time, memory, and I/O bandwidth.
