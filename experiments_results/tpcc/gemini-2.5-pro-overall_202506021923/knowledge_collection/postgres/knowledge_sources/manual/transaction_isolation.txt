The `transaction_isolation` knob reflects the current transaction's isolation level (e.g., 'READ COMMITTED', 'REPEATABLE READ', 'SERIALIZABLE'), which is initialized from `default_transaction_isolation` at the transaction's start and can be subsequently changed as if using a `SET TRANSACTION` command.
