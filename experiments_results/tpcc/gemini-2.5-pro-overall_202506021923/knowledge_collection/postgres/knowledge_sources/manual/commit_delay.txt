The `commit_delay` setting (default 0 microseconds) introduces a configurable delay before a WAL flush to improve group commit throughput by allowing more transactions to be flushed together, but this increases latency by up to the `commit_delay` value and only activates if at least `commit_siblings` other transactions are active.
