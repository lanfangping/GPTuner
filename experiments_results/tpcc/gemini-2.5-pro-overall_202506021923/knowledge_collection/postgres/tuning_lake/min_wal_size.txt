{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `min_wal_size` parameter, defaulting to 80MB, defines the minimum amount of WAL (Write-Ahead Log) files to retain. Its primary purpose is to ensure old WAL files are recycled for future use at checkpoints, rather than being immediately removed, as long as total WAL disk usage stays below this value; this reserves disk space to handle spikes in WAL generation. The default of 80MB is often considered low. Unless significant disk space restrictions exist, consider increasing `min_wal_size`. For light to moderate workloads, a setting between 256MB and 1GB is generally recommended. A higher `min_wal_size` helps smooth out disk space usage by preventing excessive WAL file recycling after checkpoints and ensures sufficient WAL is retained for standby server catch-up. It is crucial to keep `min_wal_size` comfortably below `max_wal_size`.'}
