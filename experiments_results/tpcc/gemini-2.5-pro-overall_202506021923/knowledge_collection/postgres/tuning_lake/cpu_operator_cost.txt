{'suggestion': "The `cpu_operator_cost` knob defines the planner's estimated cost for processing each query operator or function, which defaults to 0.0025. Consider small adjustments—such as down to 0.001 if CPUs are significantly faster than I/O, or up towards 0.005 if they are relatively slower—to help the planner better reflect actual resource usage."}
