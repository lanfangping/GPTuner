{'suggestion': "To accelerate maintenance tasks such as VACUUM and index rebuilds, consider increasing `maintenance_work_mem`. This is particularly beneficial for systems with substantial RAM, frequent write operations, or very large databases. Set `maintenance_work_mem` to a significant value, typically ranging from 256MB to 1GB, or even 2GB-4GB for systems with ample RAM. Be mindful that, unless `autovacuum_work_mem` is specifically set, each autovacuum worker may use this amount of memory. Consequently, it's crucial to ensure that the total memory potentially consumed by all `autovacuum_max_workers` (each using `maintenance_work_mem`) combined with other concurrent maintenance operations does not exhaust available system RAM."}
