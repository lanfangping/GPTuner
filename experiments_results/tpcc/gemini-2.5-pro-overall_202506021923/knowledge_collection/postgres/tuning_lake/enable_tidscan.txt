{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `enable_tidscan` setting enables or disables the query planner's use of TID scan plan types. The default state is `on` (equivalent to `1` or `true`), which permits very fast direct row lookups using CTIDs. Consider changing this to `off` (equivalent to `0` or `false`) only if you have confirmed virtually zero usage of TID scans or are diagnosing rare cases where the query planner might suboptimally choose a TID scan."}
