{'suggestion': 'When configuring `pg_stat_statements.track`, different settings offer various levels of detail and overhead. For instance, monitoring only top-level client-issued SQL statements can be achieved with the `top` setting (often used as a default). If tracking nested statements within functions is necessary, `all` provides this capability but with increased overhead. Statement tracking can also be disabled entirely using the `none` setting.'}
