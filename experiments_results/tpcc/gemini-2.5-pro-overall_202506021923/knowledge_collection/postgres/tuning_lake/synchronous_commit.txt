{'suggestion': 'The `synchronous_commit` knob controls when transaction success is reported to the client by specifying the level of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) processing completion required, thereby balancing data safety and performance. Key settings include:\n\n- `on`: As the default setting, `on` ensures high data safety. Transactions wait for their WAL records to be flushed to disk on the primary server before success is reported.\n\n- `local`: This setting ensures transaction durability strictly on the primary server. Transactions wait for WAL to be flushed to disk locally on the primary but do not wait for acknowledgment from any standby servers.\n\n- `remote_apply`: In replicated setups, `remote_apply` offers the strongest data safety. Transactions wait until their WAL records are received, flushed, applied, and visible on a synchronous standby server before success is reported.\n\n- `off`: For maximum performance, `off` allows transactions to report success immediately, without waiting for WAL records to be flushed to disk. This introduces a risk of data loss for recent transactions (potentially a window up to three times `wal_writer_delay`) if the server crashes.'}
