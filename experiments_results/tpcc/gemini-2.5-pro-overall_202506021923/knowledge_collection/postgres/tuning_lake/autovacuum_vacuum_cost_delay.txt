{'suggestion': "The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` parameter specifies the sleep duration, defaulting to 2 milliseconds, that automatic VACUUM operations will observe after accumulating a certain cost (defined by `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit`). This delay, typically set between its default (2ms, particularly in PostgreSQL 12 and newer) and 20ms, can be increased (e.g., to 10-20ms) to reduce autovacuum's immediate I/O impact on concurrent queries by making it pause after processing each batch of I/O operations."}
