{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `enable_sort` parameter, which is on by default (value 1), allows the query planner to use explicit sort steps. It is generally recommended to keep `enable_sort` set to `ON`. Turning it off (value 0) discourages the planner from using explicit sort steps if alternative methods are available; however, explicit sorts cannot be entirely suppressed even with this setting off. Consideration should be given to setting `enable_sort` to `OFF` only as a last resort if the planner consistently chooses suboptimal sort-based plans, particularly when `work_mem` is already sufficiently large (e.g., many megabytes or gigabytes, depending on the workload).'}
