{'suggestion': "The `enable_seqscan` knob defaults to 'on' (or `1`). It can be set to 'off' (or `0`) to discourage the query planner from using sequential scan plan types if alternative methods are available. This setting can be used, for instance, at the session level for specific query debugging or to force an index scan if the planner is suspected of making a poor choice. However, it's important to note that setting `enable_seqscan` to 'off' cannot suppress sequential scans entirely."}
