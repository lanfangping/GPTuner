{'suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` defines the minimum number of rows that must be updated or deleted in a single table, defaulting to 50, before an autovacuum `VACUUM` process is triggered on that table. For very active, large tables, this threshold might be increased to values like 500-5000 (or even higher on a per-table basis), especially when `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` is also significantly reduced to make vacuuming more responsive to the percentage of dead rows.'}
