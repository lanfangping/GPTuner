{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `transaction_isolation` knob reflects the current transaction's isolation level, which is initialized from `default_transaction_isolation` at the transaction's start and can be subsequently changed as if using a `SET TRANSACTION` command. Common isolation levels include 'READ COMMITTED' (the default, offering a good balance), 'REPEATABLE READ', and 'SERIALIZABLE'. 'REPEATABLE READ' and 'SERIALIZABLE' offer progressively stronger data consistency guarantees, preventing phenomena like non-repeatable reads or phantoms respectively, and are used when specific application logic demands such enhanced data integrity."}
