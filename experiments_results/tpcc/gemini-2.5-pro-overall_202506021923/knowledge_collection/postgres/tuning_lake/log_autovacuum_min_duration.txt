{'suggestion': 'To monitor autovacuum performance, set the `log_autovacuum_min_duration` parameter. This logs autovacuum actions if they execute for at least the specified duration. For instance, setting it to values like 250ms, 1000ms (1 second), or up to 5000ms (5 seconds) helps identify tables that are taking an unusually long time to vacuum. To log all autovacuum actions, set this parameter to 0.'}
