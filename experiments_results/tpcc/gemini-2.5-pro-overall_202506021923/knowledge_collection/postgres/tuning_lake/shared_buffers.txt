{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `shared_buffers` parameter configures the amount of memory for shared memory buffers, defaulting to 128MB. For dedicated servers with 1GB+ RAM, a common recommendation is 25% of system RAM, generally not exceeding 40%, as very large values can diminish returns by competing with the OS cache. However, it is crucial to perform your own benchmarks by varying this parameter to find the optimal setting for your specific workload. For non-dedicated servers, adjust this value accordingly, considering that each PostgreSQL instance will reserve its own memory allocations. If you are allocating hundreds of GBs to `shared_buffers`, consider setting up huge pages. This parameter is also directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`.'}
