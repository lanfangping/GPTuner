{'comprehensive_suggestion': "`vacuum_multixact_freeze_table_age` defines the age of a table's oldest multixact ID (defaulting to 150 million multixacts) at which VACUUM will perform an aggressive scan, checking every page that might contain unfrozen multixact IDs. To prevent multixact ID wraparound, ensure this value is significantly lower—for instance, 50-75%—than `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age` (default 400 million), allowing ample time for these aggressive autovacuum operations."}
