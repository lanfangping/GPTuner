{'suggestion': 'For `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`, tailor the setting to your workload. For high-throughput OLTP systems, it is advisable to keep this value low, typically 1 or 2 (the default is often 2). For analytical/Data Warehouse (DW) systems, you may raise it. When increasing, proceed cautiously, ensuring the value never exceeds `max_parallel_workers`. Only increase if specific complex queries show clear benefits without causing system-wide resource contention. Additionally, remember that this parameter is affected by `work_mem`, so review `work_mem` settings accordingly when adjusting `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`.'}
