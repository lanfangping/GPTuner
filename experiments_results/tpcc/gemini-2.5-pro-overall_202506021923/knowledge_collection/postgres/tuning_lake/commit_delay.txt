{'suggestion': 'The `commit_delay` setting introduces a configurable delay before a WAL flush, typically set to a small value (e.g., 20-200 Âµs), to improve group commit throughput by allowing more transactions to be flushed together. This delay only activates if at least `commit_siblings` other transactions are active and is particularly effective when `synchronous_commit` is `on`. While this can enhance throughput, it increases individual transaction latency by up to the `commit_delay` value. Therefore, carefully balance the potential throughput gains against this increased latency.'}
