{'suggestion': 'Adjust `cpu_tuple_cost` to better guide the query planner. Start with its default value (typically 0.01, relative to `seq_page_cost` of 1.0, implying that processing 100 tuples is as costly as one sequential page I/O). If your CPU is fast relative to I/O, incrementally decrease this value (e.g., to 0.005). Conversely, if CPU is a significant bottleneck, increase it (e.g., to 0.02).'}
