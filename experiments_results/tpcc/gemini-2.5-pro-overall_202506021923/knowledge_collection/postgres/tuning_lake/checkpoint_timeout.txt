{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `checkpoint_timeout` parameter specifies the maximum interval between automatic WAL checkpoints, with a default of 5 minutes. Adjusting this value requires balancing the desired speed of crash recovery against I/O overhead. Lower settings, such as the default 5 minutes (300 seconds), trigger more frequent checkpoints, which can shorten recovery times after a crash but may increase overall I/O load. Conversely, higher settings (e.g., 15-30 minutes or 900-1800 seconds) reduce checkpoint frequency, typically lowering the aggregate I/O impact from checkpoints. However, this can extend crash recovery duration and potentially lead to larger, less frequent I/O spikes during checkpoint operations; such spikes can often be smoothed by tuning `checkpoint_completion_target` and `bgwriter` activity.'}
