{'suggestion': 'The `max_connections` knob defines the maximum number of concurrent connections to the database server, typically defaulting to 100 (though it may be less due to kernel limitations), and can only be set at server start. For most use cases, you should use connection pooling. When using connection pooling in transaction mode, set this parameter as a low multiple (2-5x) of the number of cores on the server; if running in session mode, set it to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued. If not using connection pooling, set `max_connections` to the required number of concurrent users, though performance may be suboptimal. Ensure the server has sufficient RAM as each connection consumes several megabytes.'}
