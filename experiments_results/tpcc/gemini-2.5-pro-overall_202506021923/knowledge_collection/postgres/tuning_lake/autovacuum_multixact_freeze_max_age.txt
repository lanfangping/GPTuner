{'suggestion': "The `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age` parameter defines the maximum age (defaulting to 400 million multixacts) for a table's oldest multixact ID before a forced autovacuum is triggered to prevent multixact ID wraparound. To ensure ample time for autovacuum and stay well below the hard limit, it's recommended to set this parameter to its default of 400 million."}
