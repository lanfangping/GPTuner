{'suggestion': 'The `max_worker_processes` setting defines the maximum number of background processes supported by the system, defaulting to 8. This parameter can only be configured at server startup. For standby servers, `max_worker_processes` must be set to a value equal to or greater than that of the master server to permit queries. To determine an appropriate value, consider it as the sum of all worker parameters, such as `max_parallel_workers` (often aligned with the number of CPU cores, e.g., 4 or 8), `max_logical_replication_workers` (typically defaulting to 4 if replication is used), and essential system background processes like autovacuum and the background writer, which usually consume about 2-5 processes.'}
