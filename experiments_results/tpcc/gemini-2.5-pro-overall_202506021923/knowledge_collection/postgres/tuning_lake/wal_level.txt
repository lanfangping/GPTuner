{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `wal_level` parameter influences Write-Ahead Log (WAL) verbosity, with each level cumulatively including the data written by lower levels. For basic crash recovery, use `minimal`, typically reserved for standalone systems where this is the sole requirement. The `replica` setting, which is the default, supports WAL archiving, point-in-time recovery (PITR), and replication (including streaming replication, as used since PostgreSQL 9.6, replacing older `archive` and `hot_standby` settings). If you additionally require logical decoding and logical replication, set `wal_level` to `logical`, which includes all information from `replica` plus the necessary data for these advanced features.'}
