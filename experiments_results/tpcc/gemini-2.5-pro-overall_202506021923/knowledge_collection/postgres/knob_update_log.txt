The default of 80MB is often considered low. Unless significant disk space restrictions exist, consider increasing `min_wal_size`. For light to moderate workloads, a setting between 256MB and 1GB is generally recommended.

I first give you a knob of postgres, determine if it is related to resources, focusing primarily on CPU, RAM, disk size, and disk type. Note that some knobs may not appear directly related to resources but are indeed associated with them, so please exercise careful discernment. 

let's think step by step

step 1: Summarize the function of  knob from postgres  with no more than five sentences.
step 2: Judge whether this knob is related to cpu, ram, disk type or disk size.
step 3: If the knob is related to any hardware resource in step 2, return the boolean value true, otherwise, return the boolean value false.

Please give me the result in json format.

enable_seqscan
TUNING_SUGGESTION:
{'suggestion': "The `enable_seqscan` knob defaults to 'on' (or `1`). It can be set to 'off' (or `0`) to discourage the query planner from using sequential scan plan types if alternative methods are available. This setting can be used, for instance, at the session level for specific query debugging or to force an index scan if the planner is suspected of making a poor choice. However, it's important to note that setting `enable_seqscan` to 'off' cannot suppress sequential scans entirely."}
