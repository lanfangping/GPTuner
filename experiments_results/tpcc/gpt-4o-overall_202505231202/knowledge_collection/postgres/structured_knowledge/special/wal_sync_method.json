{"think_procedure": "The 'wal_sync_method' knob in PostgreSQL is used to specify the method used for synchronizing the write-ahead log (WAL) to disk. It is not a numerical knob, but rather a string knob that accepts specific method names such as 'fsync', 'fdatasync', 'open_sync', and 'open_datasync'. These values determine the system call used for WAL synchronization. Since 'wal_sync_method' does not have numerical values and does not include special values like -1 or 0 that alter its behavior dramatically, it does not fit the criteria of a 'special numerical knob'. Therefore, it is not classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
