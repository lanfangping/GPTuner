{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'log_min_duration_statement' is a special knob, we first need to understand its function and possible values. This knob in PostgreSQL controls the logging of the duration of each completed statement. By default, it is set to -1, which means no statement durations are logged. If set to 0, all statement durations are logged. If set to a positive number, only statements running longer than that number of milliseconds are logged. The values -1 and 0 have special meanings: -1 disables logging, and 0 logs all statements, which alters its behavior compared to when it is set to a positive number. Therefore, since -1 and 0 break the natural numerical order and perform distinct functions, this knob should be classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": [-1, 0]}
