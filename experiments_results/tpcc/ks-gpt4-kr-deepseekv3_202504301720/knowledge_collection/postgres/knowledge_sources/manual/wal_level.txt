The `wal_level` knob in PostgreSQL determines WAL logging detail with three levels: *minimal* (least WAL, no row data for certain operations), *replica* (default, supports archiving/replication, adding ~20-30% more WAL than minimal), and *logical* (adds logical decoding info, increasing WAL volume further, especially with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` and frequent UPDATE/DELETEs). It requires a server restart to change.
