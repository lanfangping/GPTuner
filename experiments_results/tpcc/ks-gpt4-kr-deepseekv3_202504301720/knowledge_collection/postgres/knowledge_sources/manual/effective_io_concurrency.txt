The `effective_io_concurrency` knob sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations PostgreSQL can initiate (range: 1–1000, or 0 to disable), with recommended values starting at the number of drives in a RAID 0/1 array (excluding RAID 5 parity), typically 2–8 for HDDs or hundreds for SSDs, defaulting to 1 if supported or 0 otherwise.
