"The 'enable_nestloop' knob controls the query planner's use of nested-loop joins, defaulting to 'on' but discouraging them (though not eliminating them entirely) when set to 'off' if alternative join methods are available."  

*(Note: If concrete numbers, such as performance metrics or thresholds, were available, they could be includedâ€”e.g., "reducing nested-loop usage by ~30% when disabled." However, the original description lacks such specifics.)*
