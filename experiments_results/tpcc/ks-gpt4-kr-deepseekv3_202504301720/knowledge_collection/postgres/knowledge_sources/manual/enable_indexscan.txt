"The 'enable_indexscan' parameter (default: on) controls whether the query planner uses index-scan and index-only-scan plans, improving performance by leveraging indexed data access when enabled."  

*(If more precision is needed, you could add: "Index scans can reduce query execution time by orders of magnitude for selective queries (e.g., fetching 0.1% of rows from a large table).")*
