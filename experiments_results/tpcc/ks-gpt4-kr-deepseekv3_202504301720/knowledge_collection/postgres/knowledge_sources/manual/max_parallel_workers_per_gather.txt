The `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter sets the maximum number of parallel workers (default: 2, with 0 disabling parallelism) a single Gather or Gather Merge node can use, though actual worker availability depends on `max_worker_processes` and `max_parallel_workers`, and each worker consumes resources like an additional sessionâ€”e.g., 4 workers may use 5x more CPU, memory, and I/O than a non-parallel query.
