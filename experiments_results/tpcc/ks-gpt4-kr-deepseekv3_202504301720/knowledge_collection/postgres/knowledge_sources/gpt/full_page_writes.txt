To set the `full_page_writes` knob in PostgreSQL, disable it (`full_page_writes = off`) if you have a battery-backed write cache or a reliable filesystem (e.g., ZFS with atomic writes), as it reduces overhead, but keep it enabled (`full_page_writes = on`, the default) otherwise to prevent partial-page corruption during crashes. Benchmark with typical workloads (e.g., 10â€“20% write-heavy transactions) to assess performance impact.
