To set the `max_worker_processes` knob in PostgreSQL, a general rule is to allocate **1 worker per CPU core** (e.g., 8 for an 8-core server), but adjust higher (e.g., 16–24) if parallel queries are heavily used or lower (e.g., 4–8) if the system also handles other workloads, while ensuring the total (including `max_parallel_workers`) does not exceed the configured value (default: 8).
