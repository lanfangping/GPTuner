To set the `autovacuum_naptime` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on your workload frequency—typically **1–10 minutes** (e.g., `1min` for high-churn systems or `5–10min` for lighter loads)—balancing between timely cleanup and resource overhead.  

*(Example: `autovacuum_naptime = '5min'` in `postgresql.conf`.)*
