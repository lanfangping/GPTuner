To set `autovacuum_max_workers`, allocate **1 worker per CPU core (up to 3-5 workers for typical systems)**, but ensure the total (including other background processes) does not exceed **50-60% of available CPU cores** to avoid contention; for example, on an **8-core server**, use **3-4 workers**. Adjust higher (e.g., **5-8 workers**) only if facing significant table bloat or aggressive vacuum needs, but monitor CPU and I/O load.
