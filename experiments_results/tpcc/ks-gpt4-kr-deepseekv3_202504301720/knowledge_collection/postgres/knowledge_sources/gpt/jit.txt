To set the `jit` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it with `jit = on` (default) for queries benefiting from JIT compilation (typically complex queries with expressions or aggregates), or set `jit_above_cost = 100000` (default) to control when JIT is triggered based on the query's estimated cost, adjusting higher (e.g., `300000`) to reduce overhead for simpler queries or lower (e.g., `50000`) to accelerate more queries. Fine-tune further with `jit_inline_above_cost` (default `500000`) and `jit_optimize_above_cost` (default `500000`) if deeper optimization is needed.
