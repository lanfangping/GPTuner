To set the `enable_partition_pruning` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (`on` or `true`) for partitioned tables to improve query performance by skipping irrelevant partitions (default is `on` in PostgreSQL 11+), or disable it (`off` or `false`) only for debugging or when pruning causes unexpected behavior (e.g., plan instability). No numeric tuning is required—it’s a binary (`on/off`) parameter.
