To set the `fsync` knob in PostgreSQL, typically leave it enabled (`fsync = on`) for data durability, but if you need maximum performance and can tolerate potential data loss (e.g., in a testing environment), disable it (`fsync = off`), which can improve write throughput by 2x or more, though this risks losing up to the last `wal_writer_delay` (default 200ms) of transactions in a crash.
