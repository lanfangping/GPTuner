To set the `enable_indexscan` knob in PostgreSQL, typically leave it `on` (default) for optimal performance, but disable it (`off`) for specific queries where sequential scans are faster (e.g., when retrieving >30% of a table's rows or for very small tables). Benchmark with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to validate the choice.  

(Note: The 30% threshold is a common heuristic, but the exact tipping point depends on data distribution, index selectivity, and hardware.)
