To set `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor`, a typical recommendation is **0.1% (0.001)** for tables with frequent small updates or **0.05% (0.0005)** for highly volatile tables, while keeping it lower than `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` (often **0.2% or 0.002**) to ensure timely statistics updates for the query planner. Adjust based on table size and write patterns.  

*(Example: `ALTER TABLE my_table SET (autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.0005);` for a heavily updated table.)*
