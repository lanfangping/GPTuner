To set the `wal_level` knob in PostgreSQL, choose between `minimal` (no additional logging), `replica` (supports replication and read-only queries on standby, default for most setups), or `logical` (adds logical decoding), with `replica` typically recommended for replication scenarios and `logical` required for logical replication or CDC tools.
