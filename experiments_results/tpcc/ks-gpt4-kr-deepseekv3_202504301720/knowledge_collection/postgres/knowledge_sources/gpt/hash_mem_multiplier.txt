To set the `hash_mem_multiplier` in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on available system memory and workload: a typical starting value is **1.0**, but increase it (e.g., **1.5–2.0**) if hash operations (e.g., joins, aggregates) are slow due to disk spills, or decrease it (e.g., **0.7–1.0**) if memory usage is too high and other workloads are impacted. Monitor performance with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to validate changes.
