To set the `checkpoint_timeout` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on your workload and recovery needsâ€”typically between **5 minutes (300s)** for frequent checkpoints (minimizing crash recovery time) and **30 minutes (1800s)** for write-heavy workloads (reducing I/O overhead), with the default being **5 minutes (300s)**; balance this with `max_wal_size` to avoid excessive WAL growth.
