To set `bgwriter_lru_multiplier`, start with the default value of **2.0**, then adjust it incrementally (e.g., **1.5–3.0**) based on monitoring: lower it if background writer activity is too aggressive (causing contention) or raise it if checkpoints are too frequent (e.g., exceeding `checkpoint_warning` thresholds), while ensuring the dirty buffer ratio (from `pg_stat_bgwriter`) stays below **5–10%** of shared buffers.
