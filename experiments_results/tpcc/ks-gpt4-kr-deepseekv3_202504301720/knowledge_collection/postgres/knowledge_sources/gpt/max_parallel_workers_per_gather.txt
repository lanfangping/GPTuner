To set `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` in PostgreSQL, a common starting point is **2-4 workers** for moderate workloads on systems with **4-8 CPU cores**, scaling up to **half the available CPU cores** (e.g., **4-8 workers** on **16-core** systems) for heavily parallelizable queries, while ensuring the total (`max_worker_processes`) allows headroom for other operations. Adjust based on query performance testing and system load.
