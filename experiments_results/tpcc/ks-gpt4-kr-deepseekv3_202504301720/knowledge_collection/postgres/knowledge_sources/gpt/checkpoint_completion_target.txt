For the PostgreSQL knob `checkpoint_completion_target`, set it to **0.7â€“0.9** (e.g., 0.8) to balance checkpoint I/O load while avoiding prolonged recovery, ensuring checkpoints complete within 80% of the `checkpoint_timeout` interval (default 5 minutes). Adjust higher (e.g., 0.9) for smoother I/O or lower (e.g., 0.5) if checkpoints finish too early under heavy write loads.
