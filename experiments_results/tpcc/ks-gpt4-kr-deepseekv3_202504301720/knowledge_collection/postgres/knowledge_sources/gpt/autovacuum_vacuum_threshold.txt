To set `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`, adjust it based on table activity: for small tables (e.g., under 10,000 rows), keep the default **50**; for larger or heavily updated tables, increase it (e.g., **100â€“500**) to reduce vacuum frequency while avoiding bloat. Monitor bloat and autovacuum logs to fine-tune.  

*(Example: `SET autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 200;` for a 1M-row table with moderate updates.)*
