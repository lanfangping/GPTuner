To set `effective_cache_size` in PostgreSQL, allocate **50-75% of the system's total available RAM** (e.g., 8GB for a 16GB system), ensuring it accounts for both PostgreSQL usage and filesystem cache, while avoiding overallocation (e.g., 24GB on a 32GB system). Adjust higher if the workload is read-heavy.  

*(Example: For a server with 64GB RAM, a typical setting would be `40GB`.)*
