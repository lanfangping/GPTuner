If you decide to allocate a specific value, consider your system's available RAM—typically starting with 1/32 of total memory (e.g., 1GB on a 32GB server) is a good practice. However, ensure this allocation does not exceed `maintenance_work_mem` and leaves sufficient memory for other system processes. Adjust the value higher if autovacuum performance is slow, but be cautious not to starve other workloads."}

For systems utilizing connection pooling in transaction mode, adjust this parameter to a low multiple (2-5x) of the server's core count. In session mode, set it to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued. Without connection pooling, align it with the number of concurrent users required. Additionally, consider allocating 100 connections as a baseline, then adding 5-20 connections per CPU core, ensuring sufficient RAM (approximately 10MB per connection for shared buffers) to avoid memory contention. Adjust based on workload—higher for OLTP systems and lower for analytics—but avoid excessively high values (e.g., >500) to prevent performance degradation. Example: A 4-core server with 8GB RAM might reasonably set 'max_connections' between 120–180."}

However, be aware that fractional values may not be accurate on older platforms, necessitating adjustments to other cost parameters. On busy systems, reducing the delay can increase background writer activity, with values often set in multiples of 10ms for such scenarios. A common starting point for general use is between 2–10 milliseconds (e.g., `vacuum_cost_delay = 4ms`), which helps balance I/O throttling to avoid contention while ensuring timely vacuuming.

maintenance_work_mem
TUNING_SUGGESTION:
{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `maintenance_work_mem` knob in PostgreSQL is crucial for setting the maximum memory allocated to maintenance operations such as VACUUM and CREATE INDEX. The default setting is **64MB**, but performance can be significantly improved by increasing this value, safely up to **1GB** for operations like dead tuple collection. For systems with large RAM resources, allocating **5-10% of total RAM** (e.g., **512MB–1GB on an 8GB system**) is recommended, ensuring it does not exceed **1GB** for most workloads to avoid excessive memory usage. In cases of large databases or intensive operations, adjustments up to **2GB** can be considered, but it's advised not to exceed **20% of RAM** to prevent memory contention. It's important to note that unless directly controlled by `autovacuum_work_mem`, this setting also determines the amount of memory each autovacuum worker might use, which could multiply the total memory usage by the number of autovacuum workers (`autovacuum_max_workers`). Therefore, caution is advised when increasing this value in environments with multiple autovacuum workers. Example configuration: `SET maintenance_work_mem = '1GB';` in `postgresql.conf`."}

{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance, the `effective_cache_size` parameter should be carefully configured to reflect the planner's assumption about the available disk cache for a query, influencing the decision between index and sequential scans. The manual suggestion takes precedence, indicating this parameter includes PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel's disk cache, adjusted if `BLCKSZ` differs from 8kB. Building on this, the web_suggestion provides a formula for setting this parameter: system RAM minus (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) multiplied by 1.1, suggesting a lower value for non-dedicated servers. The gpt_suggestion, while informative, is overridden by higher-priority suggestions but supports the idea of adjusting the setting based on the system's total available RAM and workload, particularly for read-heavy scenarios. Therefore, the primary approach should follow the manual_suggestion's guidance on the parameter's purpose and the web_suggestion's calculation method, ensuring the setting is tailored to the server's specific configuration and usage."}

Lower the value if the background writer activity is too aggressive, leading to contention, or raise it if checkpoints are occurring too frequently, such as exceeding `checkpoint_warning` thresholds. Ensure that the dirty buffer ratio, as observed in `pg_stat_bgwriter`, remains below 5–10% of shared buffers.

It's important to note that actual worker availability is constrained by `max_worker_processes` and `max_parallel_workers`, and each worker consumes additional resources similar to an extra session, potentially increasing CPU, memory, and I/O usage significantly (e.g., 4 workers may use 5x more resources than a non-parallel query). For moderate workloads on systems with 4-8 CPU cores, starting with 2-4 workers is advisable, scaling up to half the available CPU cores for heavily parallelizable queries (e.g., 4-8 workers on 16-core systems), while ensuring `max_worker_processes` allows headroom for other operations. However, for high throughput OLTP systems, it's often better to limit this setting to 1 or 2 to avoid excessive resource consumption, reserving higher values for analytical or data warehousing systems where parallel processing is more beneficial.

shared_buffers
TUNING_SUGGESTION:
{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `shared_buffers` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to allocate **25% of available RAM** for dedicated servers with at least 1GB of RAM, with a maximum recommendation of up to 40% of system memory for such systems. However, this allocation should not exceed 8GB. It's important to adjust this parameter in conjunction with `effective_cache_size`, which is typically set to **50–75% of total RAM**, and consider the specific workload—OLTP systems may benefit from higher values, while mixed workloads might require balancing with other parameters like `work_mem`. For systems with hundreds of GBs of RAM, setting up huge pages is advisable. Additionally, the `shared_buffers` setting is related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`, and adjustments should be made accordingly for non-dedicated servers to account for each Postgres instance's memory allocations. Always perform benchmarks to fine-tune this parameter based on your specific environment and needs."}

{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `max_worker_processes` knob in PostgreSQL should be set to the maximum number of background processes the system can support, with a default value of 8. This setting must match or exceed the master server's value in standby mode and requires adjustments to related parallel worker parameters (`max_parallel_workers`, `max_parallel_maintenance_workers`, `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`). While a general rule suggests allocating 1 worker per CPU core, adjustments should be made based on the system's workload—higher (e.g., 16–24) if parallel queries are heavily used, or lower (e.g., 4–8) if the system also handles other workloads. It's important to ensure that the total number of workers, including those for parallel operations, does not exceed the configured `max_worker_processes` value. An alternative approach is to set it to 75% up to 90% of the number of cores for high core count systems, or to consider the sum of all worker parameters for a more detailed configuration."}

It's crucial to monitor the system's performance and memory usage, using tools like `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, to validate the effectiveness of the adjusted settings.
