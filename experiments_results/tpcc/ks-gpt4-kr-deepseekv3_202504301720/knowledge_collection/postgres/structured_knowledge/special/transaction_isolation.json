{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'transaction_isolation'. 2. Understand the typical behavior of 'transaction_isolation' in PostgreSQL, which is to set the isolation level for transactions. 3. Recognize that 'transaction_isolation' does not have a numerical value but is instead set to string values representing different isolation levels (e.g., 'read uncommitted', 'read committed', 'repeatable read', 'serializable'). 4. Determine if any of these values can be considered 'special' in the context of breaking a natural order or disabling a feature. 5. Conclude that since 'transaction_isolation' does not operate on numerical values and does not have a special value that disables a feature or breaks a natural order, it is not a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
