{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'work_mem' in PostgreSQL. 2. Research the functionality of 'work_mem' to determine if it has any special values that alter its behavior significantly from its regular numerical operation. 3. Discover that 'work_mem' does not have special values like -1 or 0 that disable or significantly change its functionality; it operates on a straightforward numerical basis where higher values allow more memory for operations. 4. Conclude that 'work_mem' is not a special knob as it lacks such special values.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
