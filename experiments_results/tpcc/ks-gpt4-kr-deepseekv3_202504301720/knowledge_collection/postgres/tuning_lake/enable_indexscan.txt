{'suggestion': "The 'enable_indexscan' parameter in PostgreSQL, which is set to 'on' by default, controls the query planner's use of index-scan and index-only-scan plans to enhance performance by utilizing indexed data access. While it's generally recommended to keep this setting enabled for optimal performance, there may be specific scenarios, such as when retrieving a large portion of a table's rows (commonly over 30%, though this threshold can vary based on data distribution, index selectivity, and hardware) or dealing with very small tables, where disabling it ('off') could lead to better performance through sequential scans. It's advisable to use the 'EXPLAIN ANALYZE' command to benchmark and validate the most efficient approach for your particular queries."}
