{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `max_wal_size` parameter in PostgreSQL sets a soft limit on the maximum size the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a default of 1 GB. It may exceed this under heavy load or other special conditions. To optimize performance, especially in write-heavy systems, consider increasing this value to reduce checkpoint frequency, with a typical range of 1GB to 4GB, and potentially higher (e.g., 8GB+) for such systems. A common guideline is to allocate 1/16th of shared_buffers or 2–4 times the checkpoint_segments default size (16MB × N). Ensure it's at least twice the size of the largest expected transaction to avoid premature checkpoints. Increasing `max_wal_size` can extend crash recovery time, so unless there are disk space constraints, adjust this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout rather than by disk space."}
