{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `enable_indexonlyscan` setting in PostgreSQL is enabled by default, allowing the query planner to utilize index-only scans for improved performance by avoiding table heap access, provided that `enable_indexscan` is also enabled. This is particularly beneficial for queries that can leverage covering indexes to reduce I/O. There is no need to adjust this setting unless specific performance tuning is required, such as disabling it (`off`/`false`) in scenarios where sequential scans are more efficient, for example, when fetching a large portion of the table's rows or when indexes are not selective enough."}
