{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `full_page_writes` knob in PostgreSQL is enabled by default to ensure crash recovery by writing full disk pages (typically 8KB) to WAL on their first post-checkpoint modification, preventing partial-page corruption at the cost of increased WAL volume. Disabling it (`full_page_writes = off`) can improve performance but risks data corruption unless you have a battery-backed write cache or a reliable filesystem (e.g., ZFS with atomic writes). It's recommended to benchmark with typical workloads (e.g., 10â€“20% write-heavy transactions) to assess the performance impact before making changes."}
