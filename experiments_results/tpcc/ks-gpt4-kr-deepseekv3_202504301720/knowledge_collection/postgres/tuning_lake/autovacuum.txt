{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To manage the 'autovacuum' feature in PostgreSQL, ensure it is enabled (default: **on**) as it controls the autovacuum launcher daemon and requires **track_counts = on** to function. It can only be disabled globally in **postgresql.conf** or via server command line, though individual tables can bypass it via storage parameters. However, autovacuum processes will still run if necessary to prevent **transaction ID wraparound**. For fine-tuning, adjust parameters such as `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` (default `0.2`) and `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` (default `50`) to specify when vacuums should be triggered based on the percentage of dead tuples plus a fixed number of rows. Additionally, customize `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` (default `-1`, inheriting `vacuum_cost_limit`'s `200`) to manage the I/O workload during vacuum operations."}
