{'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance through the `bgwriter_flush_after` knob, it is recommended to force the OS to write dirty data to storage after 512kB (default on Linux, 0 elsewhere) is written by the background writer. This approach helps in reducing fsync stalls but may potentially degrade performance for workloads between shared_buffers and the OS page cache. Adjustments based on workload and hardware, such as using lower values for light workloads or SSDs and higher values for heavy write loads or HDDs, can be considered to balance between write latency and system performance, but the primary recommendation follows the manual_suggestion's guidance."}
