{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter in PostgreSQL determines the maximum number of parallel workers a single Gather or Gather Merge node can use, with a default of 2. It's important to note that actual worker availability is constrained by `max_worker_processes` and `max_parallel_workers`, and each worker consumes additional resources similar to an extra session, potentially increasing CPU, memory, and I/O usage significantly (e.g., 4 workers may use 5x more resources than a non-parallel query). For moderate workloads on systems with 4-8 CPU cores, starting with 2-4 workers is advisable, scaling up to half the available CPU cores for heavily parallelizable queries (e.g., 4-8 workers on 16-core systems), while ensuring `max_worker_processes` allows headroom for other operations. However, for high throughput OLTP systems, it's often better to limit this setting to 1 or 2 to avoid excessive resource consumption, reserving higher values for analytical or data warehousing systems where parallel processing is more beneficial. Always adjust based on query performance testing and system load, and review the `work_mem` setting as it interacts with this parameter."}
