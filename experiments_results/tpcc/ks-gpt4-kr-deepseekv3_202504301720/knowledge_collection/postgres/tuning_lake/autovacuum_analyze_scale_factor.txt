{'suggestion': {'description': "The 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' parameter is crucial for determining when to trigger an ANALYZE operation based on a table's size and update frequency. The default setting adds 10% (0.1) of a table's size to 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold'. For tables with frequent small updates, a setting of 0.1% (0.001) is recommended, whereas for highly volatile tables, a more aggressive setting of 0.05% (0.0005) may be appropriate. It's important to ensure this value is lower than 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' (commonly set at 0.2% or 0.002) to maintain efficient query planning. Adjustments should be made considering the specific table size and write patterns. This parameter can be configured globally in 'postgresql.conf' or on a per-table basis using storage parameters.", 'example': 'For a heavily updated table, you might set: `ALTER TABLE my_table SET (autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.0005);`'}}
