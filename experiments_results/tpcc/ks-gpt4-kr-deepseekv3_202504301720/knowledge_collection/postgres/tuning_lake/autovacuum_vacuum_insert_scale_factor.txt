{'suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' parameter is set by default to 0.2 (20% of a table's size) and is added to the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' to determine when to trigger a VACUUM. This setting can be adjusted globally in postgresql.conf or per-table via storage parameters. For highly volatile tables with frequent inserts, consider lowering the scale factor to 0.1 (10%) or pairing it with a specific threshold (e.g., 1000 rows) to trigger vacuums sooner, ensuring that vacuums are initiated either when 10% of the table size or the specified number of new dead rows is reached, whichever comes first."}
