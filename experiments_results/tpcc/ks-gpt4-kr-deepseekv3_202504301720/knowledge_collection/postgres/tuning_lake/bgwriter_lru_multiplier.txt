{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `bgwriter_lru_multiplier` parameter controls the number of dirty buffers written per round by multiplying the average recent buffer demand by this factor, with a default value of 2.0. It's advisable to start with this default value and adjust it incrementally (e.g., within the range of 1.5–3.0) based on system monitoring. Lower the value if the background writer activity is too aggressive, leading to contention, or raise it if checkpoints are occurring too frequently, such as exceeding `checkpoint_warning` thresholds. Ensure that the dirty buffer ratio, as observed in `pg_stat_bgwriter`, remains below 5–10% of shared buffers. Additionally, the adjustment should respect the limit set by `bgwriter_lru_maxpages` on the number of buffers written per round to prevent excessive I/O operations. This approach balances between meeting predicted buffer needs and providing a cushion against sudden demand spikes."}
