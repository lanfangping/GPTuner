{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `max_worker_processes` knob in PostgreSQL should be set to the maximum number of background processes the system can support, with a default value of 8. This setting must match or exceed the master server's value in standby mode and requires adjustments to related parallel worker parameters (`max_parallel_workers`, `max_parallel_maintenance_workers`, `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`). While a general rule suggests allocating 1 worker per CPU core, adjustments should be made based on the system's workload—higher (e.g., 16–24) if parallel queries are heavily used, or lower (e.g., 4–8) if the system also handles other workloads. It's important to ensure that the total number of workers, including those for parallel operations, does not exceed the configured `max_worker_processes` value. An alternative approach is to set it to 75% up to 90% of the number of cores for high core count systems, or to consider the sum of all worker parameters for a more detailed configuration."}
