{'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance with the 'enable_partitionwise_join' knob, enable it ('on') for joining large partitioned tables (e.g., tables with 10+ partitions) to potentially improve performance, but be aware that this can increase memory usage linearly with the number of partitions (e.g., 100 partitions may require 100x more memory) and significantly raise planning overhead in CPU and memory. The default setting is 'off' in versions before PostgreSQL 11 and 'on' in version 11 and later. Consider disabling it ('off') for small partitions (e.g., <5) or when the overhead outweighs the benefits."}
