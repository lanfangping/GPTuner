{'suggestion': "The 'fsync' knob in PostgreSQL ensures data durability by forcing updates to disk via fsync() calls, preventing data corruption during crashes. However, disabling it can improve performance, though this comes with the risk of unrecoverable data loss unless the database can be recreated externally, such as during initial bulk loads or temporary batch processing."}
