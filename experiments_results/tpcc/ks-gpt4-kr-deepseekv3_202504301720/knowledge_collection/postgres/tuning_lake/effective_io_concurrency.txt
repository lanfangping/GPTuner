{'suggestion': {'description': 'The `effective_io_concurrency` knob in PostgreSQL should be set based on your storage subsystem. For a RAID 0/1 array (excluding RAID 5 parity), start with the number of drives, typically 2â€“8 for HDDs or hundreds for SSDs. For more specific scenarios: use 1 for single HDDs, 2-4 for RAID arrays (depending on disks), 100-200 for SSDs, and 200-300 for high-end NVMe storage. Adjust within these ranges to balance I/O parallelism without overloading the system. The default value is 1 if supported or 0 otherwise.'}}
