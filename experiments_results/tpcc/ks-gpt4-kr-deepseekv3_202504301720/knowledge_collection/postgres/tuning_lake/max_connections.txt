{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To effectively set the 'max_connections' knob in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 100, ensuring it matches or exceeds the master server's value on a standby server for query allowance. For systems utilizing connection pooling in transaction mode, adjust this parameter to a low multiple (2-5x) of the server's core count. In session mode, set it to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued. Without connection pooling, align it with the number of concurrent users required. Additionally, consider allocating 100 connections as a baseline, then adding 5-20 connections per CPU core, ensuring sufficient RAM (approximately 10MB per connection for shared buffers) to avoid memory contention. Adjust based on workload—higher for OLTP systems and lower for analytics—but avoid excessively high values (e.g., >500) to prevent performance degradation. Example: A 4-core server with 8GB RAM might reasonably set 'max_connections' between 120–180."}
