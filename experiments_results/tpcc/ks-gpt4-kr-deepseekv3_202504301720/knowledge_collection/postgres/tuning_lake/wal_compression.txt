{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `wal_compression` knob in PostgreSQL, when enabled (default: off), compresses full page images in WAL, reducing storage usage by up to 80% (depending on data compressibility) at the cost of additional CPU overhead for compression and decompression during WAL logging and replay. Enable it if reducing storage usage is a priority, despite the CPU overhead. Disable it if CPU resources are constrained and storage is not a concern.'}
