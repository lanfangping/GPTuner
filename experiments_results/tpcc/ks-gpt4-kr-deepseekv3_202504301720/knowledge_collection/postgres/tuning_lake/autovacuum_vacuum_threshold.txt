{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' parameter determines the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples (default: 50) needed to initiate an automatic VACUUM operation on a table. This default setting can be adjusted for individual tables through storage parameters. For optimal performance, consider the table's size and activity level: maintain the default for small tables (under 10,000 rows), but for larger or more frequently updated tables, increasing the threshold (e.g., to 100â€“500) may reduce vacuum frequency without leading to bloat. It's crucial to monitor bloat and autovacuum logs to adjust the setting as needed. Example: setting `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 200;` for a table with 1 million rows and moderate update activity."}
