{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'default_statistics_target' knob in PostgreSQL sets the default statistics sampling size for table columns, with a default value of 100. Adjusting this value higher (e.g., between 100 and 1000) can improve query planner estimates, especially for complex workloads or large tables, but it also increases ANALYZE runtime and storage usage. For medium-sized systems, a value around 200 is typically sufficient, while larger systems or data warehouses may benefit from values between 500 and 1000. It's important to understand the trade-offs between improved query planning accuracy and the increased resource usage when raising this value."}
