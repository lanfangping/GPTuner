{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` parameter is crucial for managing the I/O load of autovacuum operations. It is recommended to start with the default value, which is inherited from `vacuum_cost_limit` if not explicitly set (default -1), and adjust it incrementally if autovacuum operations are too slow. The total cost limit is distributed proportionally among workers, ensuring a balance between I/O load and system performance without starving other operations. For example, with a limit of 200 and 4 workers, each worker would get a cost limit of 50. Adjustments should be made carefully to maintain system stability and performance.'}
