{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `maintenance_work_mem` knob in PostgreSQL is crucial for setting the maximum memory allocated to maintenance operations such as VACUUM and CREATE INDEX. The default setting is **64MB**, but performance can be significantly improved by increasing this value, safely up to **1GB** for operations like dead tuple collection. For systems with large RAM resources, allocating **5-10% of total RAM** (e.g., **512MBâ€“1GB on an 8GB system**) is recommended, ensuring it does not exceed **1GB** for most workloads to avoid excessive memory usage. In cases of large databases or intensive operations, adjustments up to **2GB** can be considered, but it's advised not to exceed **20% of RAM** to prevent memory contention. It's important to note that unless directly controlled by `autovacuum_work_mem`, this setting also determines the amount of memory each autovacuum worker might use, which could multiply the total memory usage by the number of autovacuum workers (`autovacuum_max_workers`). Therefore, caution is advised when increasing this value in environments with multiple autovacuum workers. Example configuration: `SET maintenance_work_mem = '1GB';` in `postgresql.conf`."}
