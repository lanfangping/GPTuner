{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure `autovacuum_work_mem`, it is recommended to set it to a maximum of 1GB per autovacuum worker for dead tuple collection, as exceeding this limit does not provide additional benefits. The default setting is -1, which means it uses `maintenance_work_mem` (default 64MB). If you decide to allocate a specific value, consider your system's available RAMâ€”typically starting with 1/32 of total memory (e.g., 1GB on a 32GB server) is a good practice. However, ensure this allocation does not exceed `maintenance_work_mem` and leaves sufficient memory for other system processes. Adjust the value higher if autovacuum performance is slow, but be cautious not to starve other workloads."}
