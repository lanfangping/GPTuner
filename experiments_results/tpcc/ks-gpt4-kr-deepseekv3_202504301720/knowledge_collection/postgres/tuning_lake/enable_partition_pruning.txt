{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_partition_pruning' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's ability to eliminate partitions from query plans, thereby improving performance by reducing the amount of data scanned. It is recommended to keep this setting enabled ('on' or 'true') for partitioned tables to enhance query performance by skipping irrelevant partitions, as this is the default behavior in PostgreSQL 11 and later versions. Disabling it ('off' or 'false') should only be considered for debugging purposes or in cases where partition pruning leads to unexpected behavior, such as plan instability. This parameter operates as a binary switch ('on/off') and does not require numeric tuning."}
