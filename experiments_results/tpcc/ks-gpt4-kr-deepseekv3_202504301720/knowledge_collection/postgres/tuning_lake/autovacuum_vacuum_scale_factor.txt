{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` parameter determines the fraction of a table's size (default 0.2, or 20%) added to `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` to decide when to trigger a VACUUM operation. It is configurable globally in `postgresql.conf` or per-table via storage parameters. A typical starting value is 0.2 (20% of table size), but it should be adjusted lower (e.g., 0.05–0.1) for large tables to prevent excessive bloat, or higher (e.g., 0.3–0.5) for small, frequently updated tables to reduce autovacuum frequency. Monitoring table-specific statistics (e.g., dead tuple ratios) is recommended to refine the value."}
