{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure the `vacuum_multixact_freeze_min_age` parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to a value such as the default **5 million multixacts** or adjust it higher (e.g., **10000â€“20000**) to find a balance between minimizing unnecessary freezes and preventing transaction ID wraparound. It's crucial to ensure the value does not exceed half of `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age` to prevent too frequent autovacuums. This approach combines the need for timely freezing with the goal of optimizing database performance."}
