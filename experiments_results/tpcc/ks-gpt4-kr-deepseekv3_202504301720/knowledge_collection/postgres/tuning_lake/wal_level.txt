{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `wal_level` knob in PostgreSQL determines the detail of WAL logging with three levels: *minimal* (least WAL, no row data for certain operations), *replica* (default, supports archiving/replication, adding ~20-30% more WAL than minimal), and *logical* (adds logical decoding info, increasing WAL volume further, especially with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` and frequent UPDATE/DELETEs). It requires a server restart to change. While `replica` is typically recommended for replication scenarios, `logical` is required for logical replication or CDC tools.'}
