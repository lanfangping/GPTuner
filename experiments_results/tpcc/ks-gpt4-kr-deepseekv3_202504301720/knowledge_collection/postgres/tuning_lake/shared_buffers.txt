{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `shared_buffers` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to allocate **25% of available RAM** for dedicated servers with at least 1GB of RAM, with a maximum recommendation of up to 40% of system memory for such systems. However, this allocation should not exceed 8GB. It's important to adjust this parameter in conjunction with `effective_cache_size`, which is typically set to **50–75% of total RAM**, and consider the specific workload—OLTP systems may benefit from higher values, while mixed workloads might require balancing with other parameters like `work_mem`. For systems with hundreds of GBs of RAM, setting up huge pages is advisable. Additionally, the `shared_buffers` setting is related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`, and adjustments should be made accordingly for non-dedicated servers to account for each Postgres instance's memory allocations. Always perform benchmarks to fine-tune this parameter based on your specific environment and needs."}
