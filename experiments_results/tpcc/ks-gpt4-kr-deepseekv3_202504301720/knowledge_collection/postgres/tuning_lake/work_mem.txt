{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL sets the base maximum memory limit for query operations such as sorts or hash tables before spilling to disk, with a default value of 4MB which is generally considered too small for modern systems. It's recommended to adjust this value based on the server's available RAM, the complexity of the queries, and the number of concurrent operations. For OLTP queries, a lower MB range may suffice, whereas OLAP-style queries with few concurrent operations might require values in the GB range. A good starting point is 16MB for most systems, adjusting upwards as needed while ensuring the total potential memory consumption (considering max_connections and concurrent operations) does not destabilize the node. Monitoring performance is crucial to avoid excessive disk usage or contention. Example: For a server with 16GB RAM and 20 concurrent operations, starting with `work_mem = 200MB` (16GB Ã— 0.25 / 20) could be effective."}
