{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure the 'vacuum_freeze_min_age' knob in PostgreSQL, set it to a value that balances the prevention of transaction ID wraparound with the avoidance of excessive vacuum overhead. The default value is 50 million transactions, but for long-running databases, a value between 100-150 million is often recommended. It's important to note that this setting is effectively capped at half of 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' to prevent excessively frequent forced autovacuums."}
