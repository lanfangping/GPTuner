{'suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age` parameter should be set to a value that prevents multixact ID wraparound while considering the frequency of autovacuum runs. The default value is **400 million multixacts**, which forces a `VACUUM` to prevent wraparound even if autovacuum is disabled. If adjusting this value, consider a range between **100 million (100,000,000)** and **200 million (200,000,000)**, with **150 million** as a common midpoint for balancing between avoiding wraparound warnings and reducing maintenance overhead. Adjust lower if wraparound warnings occur or higher to minimize maintenance.'}
