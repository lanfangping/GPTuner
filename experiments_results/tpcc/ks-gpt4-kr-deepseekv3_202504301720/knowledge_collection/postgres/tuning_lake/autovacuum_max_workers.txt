{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_max_workers' parameter sets the maximum number of concurrent autovacuum worker processes (excluding the launcher) to **3 by default**, and this value can only be configured during server startup. For systems requiring more aggressive vacuuming, consider allocating **1 worker per CPU core (up to 3-5 workers for typical systems)**, ensuring the total does not exceed **50-60% of available CPU cores** to avoid contention. For example, on an **8-core server**, use **3-4 workers**. Adjust higher (e.g., **5-8 workers**) only if facing significant table bloat or aggressive vacuum needs, but monitor CPU and I/O load closely."}
