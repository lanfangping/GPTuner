{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance, the `effective_cache_size` parameter should be carefully configured to reflect the planner's assumption about the available disk cache for a query, influencing the decision between index and sequential scans. The manual suggestion takes precedence, indicating this parameter includes PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel's disk cache, adjusted if `BLCKSZ` differs from 8kB. Building on this, the web_suggestion provides a formula for setting this parameter: system RAM minus (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) multiplied by 1.1, suggesting a lower value for non-dedicated servers. The gpt_suggestion, while informative, is overridden by higher-priority suggestions but supports the idea of adjusting the setting based on the system's total available RAM and workload, particularly for read-heavy scenarios. Therefore, the primary approach should follow the manual_suggestion's guidance on the parameter's purpose and the web_suggestion's calculation method, ensuring the setting is tailored to the server's specific configuration and usage."}
