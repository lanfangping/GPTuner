{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure the 'lock_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL, set a value that aborts any statement waiting longer than the specified time to acquire a lock, with the value interpreted as milliseconds if no unit is provided (e.g., 5000 for 5 seconds). This setting applies separately to each lock attempt for both explicit and implicit locks. For optimal performance, consider your workload: typically choose **100ms-300ms** for OLTP systems to minimize long waits, **1s-10s** for analytical queries to accommodate complex operations, or **0** (disabled) for maintenance tasks. Always test under realistic conditions to find the right balance between reducing lock contention and ensuring query success rates. Adjust ranges as necessary, such as stricter OLTP systems possibly using 50ms-200ms, while batch jobs might tolerate 30s or more."}
