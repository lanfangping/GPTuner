{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` parameter sets the cost delay for autovacuum operations, with a default value of `2ms`. It can be adjusted to suit system needs: lower values (e.g., `0ms`) for aggressive vacuuming on high-I/O systems to reduce throttling and speed up vacuum, albeit with increased I/O contention, or higher values (e.g., `10ms`â€“`50ms`) for slower, less intrusive vacuuming on latency-sensitive workloads to ease I/O pressure, though this may delay maintenance. This parameter can be configured globally in postgresql.conf or per-table via storage parameters.'}
