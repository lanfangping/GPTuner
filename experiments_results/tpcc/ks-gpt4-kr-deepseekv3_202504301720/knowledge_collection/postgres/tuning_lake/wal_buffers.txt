{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure `wal_buffers` in PostgreSQL effectively, it is recommended to set it to **1/32 of shared_buffers**, which is the default behavior. The minimum size should not be less than 32kB if manually adjusted, with values specified without units being interpreted as 8kB blocks. While a typical range for most workloads is **4-16MB**, systems with high-write operations might benefit from larger values, such as **16-64MB**. It's crucial to ensure that the `wal_buffers` setting is in harmony with checkpoint and WAL tuning for optimal performance. For example, with a `shared_buffers` of 4GB, the default `wal_buffers` would be approximately 128MB, but it's advisable to cap it at 16MB unless specific adjustments are made for high-write scenarios."}
