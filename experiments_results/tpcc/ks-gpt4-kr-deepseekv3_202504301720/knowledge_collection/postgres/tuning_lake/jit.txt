{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance using JIT compilation, enable the 'jit' knob by setting it to 'on' (default), which is beneficial for complex queries. This setting improves query performance for operations that can leverage JIT compilation. While the default settings for 'jit_above_cost', 'jit_inline_above_cost', and 'jit_optimize_above_cost' are provided, the manual suggestion prioritizes the basic enabling of JIT compilation without delving into the specifics of cost thresholds, which are considered lower priority. Therefore, the primary recommendation is to ensure JIT compilation is enabled for performance gains on complex queries, as detailed in the manual suggestion."}
