{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To set the `vacuum_cost_limit` in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 200. This knob determines the accumulated cost at which the vacuuming process pauses to mitigate excessive I/O impact. Adjustments should be made based on your system's workload and storage typeâ€”higher values (e.g., 1000-2000) may be suitable for high-performance SSDs allowing more aggressive vacuuming, whereas lower values (e.g., 200-500) could be better for HDDs to prevent contention. It's crucial to monitor `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay`, `pg_stat_activity`, and disk utilization to fine-tune this parameter incrementally for optimal performance."}
