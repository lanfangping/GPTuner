{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'checkpoint_completion_target' knob should be set to **0.5** (default) to spread I/O load evenly between checkpoints, as specified by the manual_suggestion. This takes precedence over other suggestions. However, if the goal is to smooth I/O activity over larger periods or for development instances, adjusting it to a higher value like '0.9' could be considered, as mentioned in the web_suggestion. The gpt_suggestion's recommendation to set it between '0.7â€“0.9' for balancing checkpoint I/O load while avoiding prolonged recovery is noted but not prioritized due to the higher precedence of the manual_suggestion."}
