{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `vacuum_cost_delay` parameter in PostgreSQL controls the sleep time of the vacuum process when the cost limit is exceeded. The default value is 0ms, which disables the feature. For optimal performance, it is recommended to set this value typically under 1ms, especially on systems where aggressive vacuuming is needed. However, be aware that fractional values may not be accurate on older platforms, necessitating adjustments to other cost parameters. On busy systems, reducing the delay can increase background writer activity, with values often set in multiples of 10ms for such scenarios. A common starting point for general use is between 2–10 milliseconds (e.g., `vacuum_cost_delay = 4ms`), which helps balance I/O throttling to avoid contention while ensuring timely vacuuming. Adjust lower (e.g., `0–2ms`) for more aggressive workloads or higher (e.g., `10–50ms`) if the background vacuum impacts performance too significantly.'}
