{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_naptime' parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to define the minimum delay between autovacuum runs, with the default being **60 seconds (1 minute)**. This parameter should be adjusted in the 'postgresql.conf' file or via the server command line. The adjustment should consider your system's workload frequency, aiming for a balance between timely cleanup and resource overhead. For high-churn systems, a shorter interval like **1 minute** may be appropriate, whereas for lighter loads, intervals of **5â€“10 minutes** could be more suitable. *(Example: `autovacuum_naptime = '5min'` in `postgresql.conf`.)*"}
