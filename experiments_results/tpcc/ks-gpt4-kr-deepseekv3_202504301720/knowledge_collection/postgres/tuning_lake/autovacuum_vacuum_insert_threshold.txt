{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` parameter is used to trigger a VACUUM operation when a specified number of tuples are inserted into a table. If set to -1, it disables insert-based VACUUM triggers entirely. For setting this parameter, a recommended approach involves using the formula: `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold = autovacuum_vacuum_threshold + (autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor × table_size)`, where typical defaults are `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 50` and `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.2` (20%). Adjustments should be made based on the workload, such as increasing the threshold to `100–200` for tables with high insert activity. For instance, a 1GB table would default to triggering vacuums at approximately `200,050 rows`.'}
