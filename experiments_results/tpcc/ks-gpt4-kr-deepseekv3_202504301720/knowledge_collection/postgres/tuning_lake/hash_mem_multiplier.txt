{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimize the `hash_mem_multiplier` in PostgreSQL, consider scaling the memory limit for hash-based operations by multiplying `work_mem`. The default value is 1.0, but adjusting it can significantly impact performance. For mixed workloads or when `work_mem` is already ≥40MB, increasing the multiplier to values like 1.5, 2.0, or even higher (2.0–8.0+) can prevent spilling and alleviate memory pressure. It's crucial to monitor the system's performance and memory usage, using tools like `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, to validate the effectiveness of the adjusted settings. Adjust the multiplier based on available system memory and specific workload demands: increase it if hash operations are slow due to disk spills, or decrease it if memory usage is excessively high and negatively impacts other workloads."}
