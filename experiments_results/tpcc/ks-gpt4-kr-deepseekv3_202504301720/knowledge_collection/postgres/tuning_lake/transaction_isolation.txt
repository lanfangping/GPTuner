{'suggestion': "The 'transaction_isolation' knob in PostgreSQL allows setting the isolation level for transactions, which can be specified per transaction or globally. The available isolation levels include 'read committed' (default, offering a balance between consistency and performance), 'repeatable read' (preventing non-repeatable reads), and 'serializable' (ensuring full serializability at the cost of reduced concurrency). To set the isolation level for a specific transaction, use the command `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL <level>;` where `<level>` is your desired isolation level. Alternatively, to set a default isolation level for all transactions, modify the `default_transaction_isolation` setting in the `postgresql.conf` file. Note that 'read uncommitted' is mentioned but rarely used in PostgreSQL due to its minimal practical difference."}
