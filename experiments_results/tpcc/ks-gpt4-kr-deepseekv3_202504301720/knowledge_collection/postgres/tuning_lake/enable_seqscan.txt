{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_seqscan' parameter in PostgreSQL, which defaults to 'on', controls the query planner's use of sequential scans. It is recommended to disable it ('SET enable_seqscan = off;') when query performance analysis indicates that sequential scans are significantly slower (e.g., >10x) than index scans for critical queries. However, it should generally be left enabled by default to allow the planner to use sequential scans for small tables (e.g., <1,000 rows) or full-table operations, as sequential scans can be more efficient in these scenarios. Disabling 'enable_seqscan' discourages the planner from using sequential scans when alternative methods like index scans are available, but does not eliminate them entirely."}
