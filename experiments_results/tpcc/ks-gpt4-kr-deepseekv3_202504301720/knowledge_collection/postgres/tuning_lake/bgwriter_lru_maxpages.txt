{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'bgwriter_lru_maxpages' parameter limits the number of buffers the background writer can write per round, with a default setting of 100. For optimal performance, especially in busy databases, consider adjusting this value within the range of 100–1000 pages per cycle. The adjustment should be based on the system's workload: increase the value (e.g., to 500–1000) if checkpoints result in I/O spikes. However, ensure the setting does not exceed 5–10% of the shared buffers to prevent overloading the background writer. For instance, with 8GB of shared buffers, the maximum should be approximately 40,000 pages at an 8KB page size. It's crucial to monitor checkpoint performance and make incremental adjustments. Note: This guidance assumes PostgreSQL’s default 8KB page size; adjustments may be necessary for non-default settings."}
