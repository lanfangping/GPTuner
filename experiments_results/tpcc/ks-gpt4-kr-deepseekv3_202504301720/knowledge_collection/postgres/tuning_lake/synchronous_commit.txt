{'suggestion': 'The `synchronous_commit` knob in PostgreSQL controls WAL durability guarantees, offering modes from `off` (no wait, risking up to 3Ã— `wal_writer_delay` of data loss) to `remote_apply` (waiting for WAL to be applied on standbys). The default setting is `on`, which ensures local flush plus standby flush, providing a balance between safety and performance. For scenarios requiring specific guarantees, `remote_write` (standby OS cache write) serves as an intermediate option. Adjust the setting based on your durability needs: use `off` for bulk loads where performance is prioritized over immediate durability, and `on` or more stringent settings for critical transactions where data safety is paramount.'}
