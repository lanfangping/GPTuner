            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

It is configurable globally in `postgresql.conf` or per-table via storage parameters. A typical starting value is 0.2 (20% of table size), but it should be adjusted lower (e.g., 0.05–0.1) for large tables to prevent excessive bloat, or higher (e.g., 0.3–0.5) for small, frequently updated tables to reduce autovacuum frequency.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting.

It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            KNOB: autovacuum
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "To manage the 'autovacuum' feature in PostgreSQL, ensure it is enabled (default: **on**) as it controls the autovacuum launcher daemon and requires **track_counts = on** to function. It can only be disabled globally in **postgresql.conf** or via server command line, though individual tables can bypass it via storage parameters. However, autovacuum processes will still run if necessary to prevent **transaction ID wraparound**. For fine-tuning, adjust parameters such as `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` (default `0.2`) and `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` (default `50`) to specify when vacuums should be triggered based on the percentage of dead tuples plus a fixed number of rows. Additionally, customize `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` (default `-1`, inheriting `vacuum_cost_limit`'s `200`) to manage the I/O workload during vacuum operations."}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure `autovacuum_work_mem`, it is recommended to set it to a maximum of 1GB per autovacuum worker for dead tuple collection, as exceeding this limit does not provide additional benefits. The default setting is -1, which means it uses `maintenance_work_mem` (default 64MB). If you decide to allocate a specific value, consider your system's available RAM—typically starting with 1/32 of total memory (e.g., 1GB on a 32GB server) is a good practice. However, ensure this allocation does not exceed `maintenance_work_mem` and leaves sufficient memory for other system processes. Adjust the value higher if autovacuum performance is slow, but be cautious not to starve other workloads."}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "To set the `vacuum_cost_limit` in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 200. This knob determines the accumulated cost at which the vacuuming process pauses to mitigate excessive I/O impact. Adjustments should be made based on your system's workload and storage type—higher values (e.g., 1000-2000) may be suitable for high-performance SSDs allowing more aggressive vacuuming, whereas lower values (e.g., 200-500) could be better for HDDs to prevent contention. It's crucial to monitor `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay`, `pg_stat_activity`, and disk utilization to fine-tune this parameter incrementally for optimal performance."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "To effectively set the 'max_connections' knob in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 100, ensuring it matches or exceeds the master server's value on a standby server for query allowance. For systems utilizing connection pooling in transaction mode, adjust this parameter to a low multiple (2-5x) of the server's core count. In session mode, set it to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued. Without connection pooling, align it with the number of concurrent users required. Additionally, consider allocating 100 connections as a baseline, then adding 5-20 connections per CPU core, ensuring sufficient RAM (approximately 10MB per connection for shared buffers) to avoid memory contention. Adjust based on workload—higher for OLTP systems and lower for analytics—but avoid excessively high values (e.g., >500) to prevent performance degradation.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            KNOB: max_connections
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "To effectively set the 'max_connections' knob in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 100, ensuring it matches or exceeds the master server's value on a standby server for query allowance. For systems utilizing connection pooling in transaction mode, adjust this parameter to a low multiple (2-5x) of the server's core count. In session mode, set it to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued. Without connection pooling, align it with the number of concurrent users required. Additionally, consider allocating 100 connections as a baseline, then adding 5-20 connections per CPU core, ensuring sufficient RAM (approximately 10MB per connection for shared buffers) to avoid memory contention. Adjust based on workload—higher for OLTP systems and lower for analytics—but avoid excessively high values (e.g., >500) to prevent performance degradation. Example: A 4-core server with 8GB RAM might reasonably set 'max_connections' between 120–180."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

<example>
KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}
<\example>

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_seqscan' parameter in PostgreSQL, which defaults to 'on', controls the query planner's use of sequential scans. It is recommended to disable it ('SET enable_seqscan = off;') when query performance analysis indicates that sequential scans are significantly slower (e.g., >10x) than index scans for critical queries. However, it should generally be left enabled by default to allow the planner to use sequential scans for small tables (e.g., <1,000 rows) or full-table operations, as sequential scans can be more efficient in these scenarios. Disabling 'enable_seqscan' discourages the planner from using sequential scans when alternative methods like index scans are available, but does not eliminate them entirely."}

Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `vacuum_cost_delay` parameter in PostgreSQL controls the sleep time of the vacuum process when the cost limit is exceeded. The default value is 0ms, which disables the feature. For optimal performance, it is recommended to set this value typically under 1ms, especially on systems where aggressive vacuuming is needed. However, be aware that fractional values may not be accurate on older platforms, necessitating adjustments to other cost parameters. On busy systems, reducing the delay can increase background writer activity, with values often set in multiples of 10ms for such scenarios. A common starting point for general use is between 2–10 milliseconds (e.g., `vacuum_cost_delay = 4ms`), which helps balance I/O throttling to avoid contention while ensuring timely vacuuming. Adjust lower (e.g., `0–2ms`) for more aggressive workloads or higher (e.g., `10–50ms`) if the background vacuum impacts performance too significantly.'}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000".

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `maintenance_work_mem` knob in PostgreSQL is crucial for setting the maximum memory allocated to maintenance operations such as VACUUM and CREATE INDEX. The default setting is **64MB**, but performance can be significantly improved by increasing this value, safely up to **1GB** for operations like dead tuple collection. For systems with large RAM resources, allocating **5-10% of total RAM** (e.g., **512MB–1GB on an 8GB system**) is recommended, ensuring it does not exceed **1GB** for most workloads to avoid excessive memory usage. In cases of large databases or intensive operations, adjustments up to **2GB** can be considered, but it's advised not to exceed **20% of RAM** to prevent memory contention. It's important to note that unless directly controlled by `autovacuum_work_mem`, this setting also determines the amount of memory each autovacuum worker might use, which could multiply the total memory usage by the number of autovacuum workers (`autovacuum_max_workers`). Therefore, caution is advised when increasing this value in environments with multiple autovacuum workers. Example configuration: `SET maintenance_work_mem = '1GB';` in `postgresql.conf`."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

            KNOB: maintenance_work_mem
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `maintenance_work_mem` knob in PostgreSQL is crucial for setting the maximum memory allocated to maintenance operations such as VACUUM and CREATE INDEX. The default setting is **64MB**, but performance can be significantly improved by increasing this value, safely up to **1GB** for operations like dead tuple collection. For systems with large RAM resources, allocating **5-10% of total RAM** (e.g., **512MB–1GB on an 8GB system**) is recommended, ensuring it does not exceed **1GB** for most workloads to avoid excessive memory usage. In cases of large databases or intensive operations, adjustments up to **2GB** can be considered, but it's advised not to exceed **20% of RAM** to prevent memory contention. It's important to note that unless directly controlled by `autovacuum_work_mem`, this setting also determines the amount of memory each autovacuum worker might use, which could multiply the total memory usage by the number of autovacuum workers (`autovacuum_max_workers`). Therefore, caution is advised when increasing this value in environments with multiple autovacuum workers. Example configuration: `SET maintenance_work_mem = '1GB';` in `postgresql.conf`."}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance, the `effective_cache_size` parameter should be carefully configured to reflect the planner's assumption about the available disk cache for a query, influencing the decision between index and sequential scans. The manual suggestion takes precedence, indicating this parameter includes PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel's disk cache, adjusted if `BLCKSZ` differs from 8kB. Building on this, the web_suggestion provides a formula for setting this parameter: system RAM minus (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) multiplied by 1.1, suggesting a lower value for non-dedicated servers. The gpt_suggestion, while informative, is overridden by higher-priority suggestions but supports the idea of adjusting the setting based on the system's total available RAM and workload, particularly for read-heavy scenarios. Therefore, the primary approach should follow the manual_suggestion's guidance on the parameter's purpose and the web_suggestion's calculation method, ensuring the setting is tailored to the server's specific configuration and usage."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

            KNOB: effective_cache_size
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance, the `effective_cache_size` parameter should be carefully configured to reflect the planner's assumption about the available disk cache for a query, influencing the decision between index and sequential scans. The manual suggestion takes precedence, indicating this parameter includes PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel's disk cache, adjusted if `BLCKSZ` differs from 8kB. Building on this, the web_suggestion provides a formula for setting this parameter: system RAM minus (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) multiplied by 1.1, suggesting a lower value for non-dedicated servers. The gpt_suggestion, while informative, is overridden by higher-priority suggestions but supports the idea of adjusting the setting based on the system's total available RAM and workload, particularly for read-heavy scenarios. Therefore, the primary approach should follow the manual_suggestion's guidance on the parameter's purpose and the web_suggestion's calculation method, ensuring the setting is tailored to the server's specific configuration and usage."}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

It's advisable to start with this default value and adjust it incrementally (e.g., within the range of 1.5–3.0) based on system monitoring. Lower the value if the background writer activity is too aggressive, leading to contention, or raise it if checkpoints are occurring too frequently, such as exceeding `checkpoint_warning` thresholds. Ensure that the dirty buffer ratio, as observed in `pg_stat_bgwriter`, remains below 5–10% of shared buffers. Additionally, the adjustment should respect the limit set by `bgwriter_lru_maxpages` on the number of buffers written per round to prevent excessive I/O operations.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            KNOB: bgwriter_lru_multiplier
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `bgwriter_lru_multiplier` parameter controls the number of dirty buffers written per round by multiplying the average recent buffer demand by this factor, with a default value of 2.0. It's advisable to start with this default value and adjust it incrementally (e.g., within the range of 1.5–3.0) based on system monitoring. Lower the value if the background writer activity is too aggressive, leading to contention, or raise it if checkpoints are occurring too frequently, such as exceeding `checkpoint_warning` thresholds. Ensure that the dirty buffer ratio, as observed in `pg_stat_bgwriter`, remains below 5–10% of shared buffers. Additionally, the adjustment should respect the limit set by `bgwriter_lru_maxpages` on the number of buffers written per round to prevent excessive I/O operations. This approach balances between meeting predicted buffer needs and providing a cushion against sudden demand spikes."}

It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter in PostgreSQL determines the maximum number of parallel workers a single Gather or Gather Merge node can use, with a default of 2. It's important to note that actual worker availability is constrained by `max_worker_processes` and `max_parallel_workers`, and each worker consumes additional resources similar to an extra session, potentially increasing CPU, memory, and I/O usage significantly (e.g., 4 workers may use 5x more resources than a non-parallel query). For moderate workloads on systems with 4-8 CPU cores, starting with 2-4 workers is advisable, scaling up to half the available CPU cores for heavily parallelizable queries (e.g., 4-8 workers on 16-core systems), while ensuring `max_worker_processes` allows headroom for other operations. However, for high throughput OLTP systems, it's often better to limit this setting to 1 or 2 to avoid excessive resource consumption, reserving higher values for analytical or data warehousing systems where parallel processing is more beneficial. Always adjust based on query performance testing and system load, and review the `work_mem` setting as it interacts with this parameter."}

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            KNOB: max_parallel_workers_per_gather
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter in PostgreSQL determines the maximum number of parallel workers a single Gather or Gather Merge node can use, with a default of 2. It's important to note that actual worker availability is constrained by `max_worker_processes` and `max_parallel_workers`, and each worker consumes additional resources similar to an extra session, potentially increasing CPU, memory, and I/O usage significantly (e.g., 4 workers may use 5x more resources than a non-parallel query). For moderate workloads on systems with 4-8 CPU cores, starting with 2-4 workers is advisable, scaling up to half the available CPU cores for heavily parallelizable queries (e.g., 4-8 workers on 16-core systems), while ensuring `max_worker_processes` allows headroom for other operations. However, for high throughput OLTP systems, it's often better to limit this setting to 1 or 2 to avoid excessive resource consumption, reserving higher values for analytical or data warehousing systems where parallel processing is more beneficial. Always adjust based on query performance testing and system load, and review the `work_mem` setting as it interacts with this parameter."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

            KNOB: max_wal_size
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `max_wal_size` parameter in PostgreSQL sets a soft limit on the maximum size the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a default of 1 GB. It may exceed this under heavy load or other special conditions. To optimize performance, especially in write-heavy systems, consider increasing this value to reduce checkpoint frequency, with a typical range of 1GB to 4GB, and potentially higher (e.g., 8GB+) for such systems. A common guideline is to allocate 1/16th of shared_buffers or 2–4 times the checkpoint_segments default size (16MB × N). Ensure it's at least twice the size of the largest expected transaction to avoid premature checkpoints. Increasing `max_wal_size` can extend crash recovery time, so unless there are disk space constraints, adjust this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout rather than by disk space."}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

            KNOB: max_wal_size
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `max_wal_size` parameter in PostgreSQL sets a soft limit on the maximum size the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a default of 1 GB. It may exceed this under heavy load or other special conditions. To optimize performance, especially in write-heavy systems, consider increasing this value to reduce checkpoint frequency, with a typical range of 1GB to 4GB, and potentially higher (e.g., 8GB+) for such systems. A common guideline is to allocate 1/16th of shared_buffers or 2–4 times the checkpoint_segments default size (16MB × N). Ensure it's at least twice the size of the largest expected transaction to avoid premature checkpoints. Increasing `max_wal_size` can extend crash recovery time, so unless there are disk space constraints, adjust this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout rather than by disk space."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure `wal_buffers` in PostgreSQL effectively, it is recommended to set it to **1/32 of shared_buffers**, which is the default behavior. The minimum size should not be less than 32kB if manually adjusted, with values specified without units being interpreted as 8kB blocks. While a typical range for most workloads is **4-16MB**, systems with high-write operations might benefit from larger values, such as **16-64MB**. It's crucial to ensure that the `wal_buffers` setting is in harmony with checkpoint and WAL tuning for optimal performance. For example, with a `shared_buffers` of 4GB, the default `wal_buffers` would be approximately 128MB, but it's advisable to cap it at 16MB unless specific adjustments are made for high-write scenarios."}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value".

            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

            KNOB: shared_buffers
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `shared_buffers` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to allocate **25% of available RAM** for dedicated servers with at least 1GB of RAM, with a maximum recommendation of up to 40% of system memory for such systems. However, this allocation should not exceed 8GB. It's important to adjust this parameter in conjunction with `effective_cache_size`, which is typically set to **50–75% of total RAM**, and consider the specific workload—OLTP systems may benefit from higher values, while mixed workloads might require balancing with other parameters like `work_mem`. For systems with hundreds of GBs of RAM, setting up huge pages is advisable. Additionally, the `shared_buffers` setting is related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`, and adjustments should be made accordingly for non-dedicated servers to account for each Postgres instance's memory allocations. Always perform benchmarks to fine-tune this parameter based on your specific environment and needs."}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

<example>
KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'checkpoint_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL sets the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints, with a default value of 5 minutes (300 seconds). Adjusting this parameter should be based on your workload and recovery needs. For write-heavy workloads, consider increasing the value (e.g., to 15 minutes) to reduce I/O overhead, though this may lead to larger I/O spikes and extended crash recovery time. Conversely, for frequent checkpoints to minimize crash recovery time, a lower value (e.g., 5 minutes) is advisable. It's important to balance this setting with 'max_wal_size' to manage WAL growth effectively. Tuning 'checkpoint_completion_target' and bgwriter activity can help smooth out I/O spikes associated with larger checkpoint intervals."}

- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            KNOB: checkpoint_timeout
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'checkpoint_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL sets the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints, with a default value of 5 minutes (300 seconds). Adjusting this parameter should be based on your workload and recovery needs. For write-heavy workloads, consider increasing the value (e.g., to 15 minutes) to reduce I/O overhead, though this may lead to larger I/O spikes and extended crash recovery time. Conversely, for frequent checkpoints to minimize crash recovery time, a lower value (e.g., 5 minutes) is advisable. It's important to balance this setting with 'max_wal_size' to manage WAL growth effectively. Tuning 'checkpoint_completion_target' and bgwriter activity can help smooth out I/O spikes associated with larger checkpoint intervals."}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            KNOB: bgwriter_lru_maxpages
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'bgwriter_lru_maxpages' parameter limits the number of buffers the background writer can write per round, with a default setting of 100. For optimal performance, especially in busy databases, consider adjusting this value within the range of 100–1000 pages per cycle. The adjustment should be based on the system's workload: increase the value (e.g., to 500–1000) if checkpoints result in I/O spikes. However, ensure the setting does not exceed 5–10% of the shared buffers to prevent overloading the background writer. For instance, with 8GB of shared buffers, the maximum should be approximately 40,000 pages at an 8KB page size. It's crucial to monitor checkpoint performance and make incremental adjustments. Note: This guidance assumes PostgreSQL’s default 8KB page size; adjustments may be necessary for non-default settings."}
            HARDWARE INFORMATION: The machine running the dbms has a RAM of 31 GB, a CPU of 12 cores, and a 741 GB HDD drive.
            JSON RESULT TEMPLATE:
            {

                "min_value": null,      // change it if there is a hint about the minimum value in SUGGESTIONS

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'bgwriter_lru_maxpages' parameter limits the number of buffers the background writer can write per round, with a default setting of 100. For optimal performance, especially in busy databases, consider adjusting this value within the range of 100–1000 pages per cycle. The adjustment should be based on the system's workload: increase the value (e.g., to 500–1000) if checkpoints result in I/O spikes. However, ensure the setting does not exceed 5–10% of the shared buffers to prevent overloading the background writer. For instance, with 8GB of shared buffers, the maximum should be approximately 40,000 pages at an 8KB page size. It's crucial to monitor checkpoint performance and make incremental adjustments.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

This setting must match or exceed the master server's value in standby mode and requires adjustments to related parallel worker parameters (`max_parallel_workers`, `max_parallel_maintenance_workers`, `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`). While a general rule suggests allocating 1 worker per CPU core, adjustments should be made based on the system's workload—higher (e.g., 16–24) if parallel queries are heavily used, or lower (e.g., 4–8) if the system also handles other workloads. It's important to ensure that the total number of workers, including those for parallel operations, does not exceed the configured `max_worker_processes` value. An alternative approach is to set it to 75% up to 90% of the number of cores for high core count systems, or to consider the sum of all worker parameters for a more detailed configuration."}

            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],

This setting must match or exceed the master server's value in standby mode and requires adjustments to related parallel worker parameters (`max_parallel_workers`, `max_parallel_maintenance_workers`, `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`). While a general rule suggests allocating 1 worker per CPU core, adjustments should be made based on the system's workload—higher (e.g., 16–24) if parallel queries are heavily used, or lower (e.g., 4–8) if the system also handles other workloads. It's important to ensure that the total number of workers, including those for parallel operations, does not exceed the configured `max_worker_processes` value.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'.

For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.

            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            KNOB: enable_partition_pruning
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_partition_pruning' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's ability to eliminate partitions from query plans, thereby improving performance by reducing the amount of data scanned. It is recommended to keep this setting enabled ('on' or 'true') for partitioned tables to enhance query performance by skipping irrelevant partitions, as this is the default behavior in PostgreSQL 11 and later versions. Disabling it ('off' or 'false') should only be considered for debugging purposes or in cases where partition pruning leads to unexpected behavior, such as plan instability. This parameter operates as a binary switch ('on/off') and does not require numeric tuning."}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

The default value is 1.0, but adjusting it can significantly impact performance. For mixed workloads or when `work_mem` is already ≥40MB, increasing the multiplier to values like 1.5, 2.0, or even higher (2.0–8.0+) can prevent spilling and alleviate memory pressure. It's crucial to monitor the system's performance and memory usage, using tools like `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, to validate the effectiveness of the adjusted settings.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            KNOB: hash_mem_multiplier
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimize the `hash_mem_multiplier` in PostgreSQL, consider scaling the memory limit for hash-based operations by multiplying `work_mem`. The default value is 1.0, but adjusting it can significantly impact performance. For mixed workloads or when `work_mem` is already ≥40MB, increasing the multiplier to values like 1.5, 2.0, or even higher (2.0–8.0+) can prevent spilling and alleviate memory pressure. It's crucial to monitor the system's performance and memory usage, using tools like `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, to validate the effectiveness of the adjusted settings. Adjust the multiplier based on available system memory and specific workload demands: increase it if hash operations are slow due to disk spills, or decrease it if memory usage is excessively high and negatively impacts other workloads."}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting.

Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.

Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

It's recommended to adjust this value based on the server's available RAM, the complexity of the queries, and the number of concurrent operations. For OLTP queries, a lower MB range may suffice, whereas OLAP-style queries with few concurrent operations might require values in the GB range. A good starting point is 16MB for most systems, adjusting upwards as needed while ensuring the total potential memory consumption (considering max_connections and concurrent operations) does not destabilize the node. Monitoring performance is crucial to avoid excessive disk usage or contention. Example: For a server with 16GB RAM and 20 concurrent operations, starting with `work_mem = 200MB` (16GB × 0.25 / 20) could be effective."}

Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            KNOB: work_mem
            SUGGESTION: {'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL sets the base maximum memory limit for query operations such as sorts or hash tables before spilling to disk, with a default value of 4MB which is generally considered too small for modern systems. It's recommended to adjust this value based on the server's available RAM, the complexity of the queries, and the number of concurrent operations. For OLTP queries, a lower MB range may suffice, whereas OLAP-style queries with few concurrent operations might require values in the GB range. A good starting point is 16MB for most systems, adjusting upwards as needed while ensuring the total potential memory consumption (considering max_connections and concurrent operations) does not destabilize the node. Monitoring performance is crucial to avoid excessive disk usage or contention. Example: For a server with 16GB RAM and 20 concurrent operations, starting with `work_mem = 200MB` (16GB × 0.25 / 20) could be effective."}
            HARDWARE INFORMATION: The machine running the dbms has a RAM of 31 GB, a CPU of 12 cores, and a 741 GB HDD drive.
            JSON RESULT TEMPLATE:
            {
                "suggested_values": [], // these should be exact values with a unit if needed (allowable units: KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min)
                "min_value": null,      // change it if there is a hint about the minimum value in SUGGESTIONS
                "max_value": null      // change it if there is a hint about the maximum value in SUGGESTIONS, it should be larger than min_value

Database Management Systems (DBMS) have settings referred to as 'knobs'. Numerical knobs typically have a natural order. However, some 'special' numerical knobs have special values, such as -1 or 0, that break this natural order. When set to a special value, such knob performs a very different function compared to its regular operation, such as disabling a feature. Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob. Let us think step by step, please classify a knob of postgresas a 'special knob' and provide the RESULT in JSON format.
