{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_indexonlyscan' controls whether PostgreSQL allows index-only scans, which can improve performance in certain scenarios. Typically, this knob can be set to 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled), indicating a natural order. However, since it does not have a unique special value like -1 that changes its behavior fundamentally, it does not qualify as a special knob. Therefore, I conclude that it behaves like a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
