{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_parallel_append' in PostgreSQL is used to enable or disable the parallel append feature. It is a numerical knob that typically takes values like 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled). However, the value 0 specifically indicates that the feature is turned off, which is a special function compared to regular numerical values that would indicate varying levels of feature usage. Since 0 is a special value that changes the behavior of the knob significantly, it qualifies as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
