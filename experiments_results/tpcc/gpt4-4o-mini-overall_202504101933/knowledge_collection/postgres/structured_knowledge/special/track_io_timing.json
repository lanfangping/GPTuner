{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'track_io_timing' in PostgreSQL. 2. Determine if it has any special values that alter its function. 3. Check the documentation for PostgreSQL to see if 'track_io_timing' has defined special values like -1 or 0. 4. Conclude that 'track_io_timing' does not have such special values that break the natural order, as it typically accepts boolean values (on/off) or numerical values based on the configuration. 5. Since there are no special values that change its operational behavior significantly, classify it as a regular knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
