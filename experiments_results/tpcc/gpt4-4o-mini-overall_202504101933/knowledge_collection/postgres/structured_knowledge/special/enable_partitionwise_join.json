{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_partitionwise_join' is used to control whether partition-wise joins are enabled in PostgreSQL. Typically, this knob can be set to 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled). The value 0 indicates that partition-wise joins are not allowed, which is a special case that alters the behavior of the database system significantly. Therefore, this knob has a special value (0) that breaks the natural order of numerical settings. Since it has a specific function when set to 0, it qualifies as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
