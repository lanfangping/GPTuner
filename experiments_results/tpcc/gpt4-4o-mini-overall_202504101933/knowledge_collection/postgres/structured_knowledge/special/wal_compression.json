{"think_procedure": "The knob 'wal_compression' in PostgreSQL is used to enable or disable the compression of Write-Ahead Logs (WAL). It can take values like 'on', 'off', or 'default', which are not numerical in a traditional sense. However, it does not have special numerical values like -1 or 0 that alter its fundamental behavior. Therefore, it behaves like a regular knob without any special values that would classify it as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
