{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_hashjoin' in PostgreSQL controls whether the hash join algorithm is used for query execution. This knob typically has a natural ordering where setting it to 'on' enables hash joins and setting it to 'off' disables them. However, it does not have any special values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a different function or behavior. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob without any special cases.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
