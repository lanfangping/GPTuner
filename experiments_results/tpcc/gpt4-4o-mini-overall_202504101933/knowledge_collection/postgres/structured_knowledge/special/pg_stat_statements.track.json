{"think_procedure": "The knob 'pg_stat_statements.track' in PostgreSQL controls which statements are tracked by the pg_stat_statements module. It can take values like 'none', 'top', 'all', and thus has a defined order of importance. The special values 'none' and 'top' could be considered special as they change the behavior of the tracking significantly compared to 'all'. Therefore, it can be classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": ["none", "top"]}
