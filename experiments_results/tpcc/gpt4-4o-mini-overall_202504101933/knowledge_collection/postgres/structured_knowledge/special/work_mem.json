{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question, which is 'work_mem'. 2. Understand the intended functionality of 'work_mem' in PostgreSQL, which is to define the amount of memory allocated for internal sort operations and hash tables. 3. Check if 'work_mem' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly, such as -1 or 0. 4. Determine that 'work_mem' does not have a special value that breaks its natural order, as it typically accepts positive integer values representing memory in kilobytes. 5. Conclude that 'work_mem' does not perform a different function when set to a special value, as it does not have a defined special value like -1 or 0 that changes its operation. 6. Therefore, classify 'work_mem' as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
