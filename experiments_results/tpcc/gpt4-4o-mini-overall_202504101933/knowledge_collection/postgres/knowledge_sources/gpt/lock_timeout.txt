To set the `lock_timeout` in PostgreSQL, use the command `SET lock_timeout = '2s';` to specify a timeout of 2 seconds, which is typically suitable for most applications, but you can adjust it based on your workload and performance needs, with a common range being from 1 second (to quickly fail on lock waits) to several seconds for more complex transactions.
