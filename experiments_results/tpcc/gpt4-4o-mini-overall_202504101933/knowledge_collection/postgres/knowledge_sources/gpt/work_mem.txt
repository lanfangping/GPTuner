To set the 'work_mem' parameter in PostgreSQL, allocate 1-2 MB per concurrent connection for light workloads, and increase it to 4-16 MB for more demanding queries, while ensuring that the total memory usage does not exceed your system's available RAM to avoid swapping; for example, setting 'work_mem' to 16 MB is suitable for systems handling moderate workloads with up to 100 concurrent connections, resulting in a maximum usage of 1.6 GB.
