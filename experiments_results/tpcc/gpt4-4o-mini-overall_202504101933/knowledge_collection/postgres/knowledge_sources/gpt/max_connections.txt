To set the 'max_connections' parameter in PostgreSQL, start by determining the optimal value based on the expected workload, typically using a formula of `max_connections = (number of CPU cores) x (max simultaneous connections per core),` commonly set around 100 for light workloads, increasing to 200-300 for heavier workloads, while ensuring that the total memory usage does not exceed the available system RAM (e.g., 1-2 MB per connection).
