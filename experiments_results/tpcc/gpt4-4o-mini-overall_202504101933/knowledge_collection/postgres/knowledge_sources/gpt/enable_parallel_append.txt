To enable parallel append in PostgreSQL, set the `enable_parallel_append` parameter to `on` in the PostgreSQL configuration file (postgresql.conf) or during the session with the command `SET enable_parallel_append TO on;`, ensuring that the system's parallelism settings and work load management (like `max_parallel_workers` and `max_worker_processes`) are adequately configured to support the desired parallel operation.
