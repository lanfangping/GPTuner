To set the `enable_parallel_hash` parameter in PostgreSQL, you should adjust its value to `on` (enabled) for improved performance when executing hash joins with parallel processing, especially in systems with multiple CPUs, while keeping the default value at `off`; for optimal results, consider enabling this feature if you have at least 8 CPU cores and are running complex queries.
