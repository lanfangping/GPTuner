To optimize the 'synchronous_commit' setting in PostgreSQL, you can set it to 'on' for maximum durability (default), 'off' for improved write performance with potential data loss in case of a crash, or 'local' to ensure that commits are acknowledged once they are written to the local disk, which can improve performance while still providing a level of safety; you might also consider setting it to 'remote_write' for a balance between performance and safety, ensuring writes are acknowledged after they are sent to synchronous standby servers.
