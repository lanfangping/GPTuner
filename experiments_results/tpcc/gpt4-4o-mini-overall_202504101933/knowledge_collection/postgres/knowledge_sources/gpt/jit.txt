To set the 'jit' knob in PostgreSQL, you can use the command `SET jit TO 'on'` to enable JIT compilation for query execution, or 'off' to disable it, and you can adjust the `jit_above_cost` parameter to a specific cost threshold (e.g., 100000) to control which queries benefit from JIT compilation based on their estimated cost.
