To optimize performance for large queries in PostgreSQL, for the `enable_partitionwise_join` knob, you should set its value to `on` using the command `SET enable_partitionwise_join = on;` particularly when dealing with partitioned tables where each partition is often joined with corresponding partitions from other tables, especially if the number of partitions is significant (e.g., 10 or more partitions).
