To optimize query performance in PostgreSQL, you can set the `enable_indexscan` knob to `on` (default value) to allow the use of index scans, or `off` to disable them, though it is generally recommended to keep it enabled for better performance on large datasets; if adjustments are necessary, consider tuning the value gradually based on query performance metrics, for instance, by using `SET enable_indexscan TO 'off';` for specific sessions or `ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_indexscan TO 'off';` for a server-wide change, and monitoring the impact on query execution plans.
