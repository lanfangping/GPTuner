To optimize the `enable_hashjoin` setting in PostgreSQL, you can set it to `on` to allow hash joins, which is usually effective when the `work_mem` is set sufficiently high (e.g., 4MB to 64MB per query) to accommodate larger datasets, while benchmarking performance against query execution times to ensure the optimal balance for your specific workload.
