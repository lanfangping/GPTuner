To optimize the `wal_block_size` in PostgreSQL, set its value to 64 KB (the default) for general workloads, but consider increasing it to 128 KB or 256 KB for systems with large transaction sizes or high write loads, ensuring the setting aligns with the filesystem block size and memory capabilities of your database server.
