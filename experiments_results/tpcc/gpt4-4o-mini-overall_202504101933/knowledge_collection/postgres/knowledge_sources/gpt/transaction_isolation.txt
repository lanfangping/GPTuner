To set the `transaction_isolation` level in PostgreSQL, you can use the SQL command `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL <level>;`, where `<level>` can be specified as `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, or `SERIALIZABLE`, with `READ COMMITTED` being the default; alternatively, you can adjust the default value for all sessions in the `postgresql.conf` file to `transaction_isolation = 'REPEATABLE READ'` for enhanced consistency, depending on your specific application needs.
