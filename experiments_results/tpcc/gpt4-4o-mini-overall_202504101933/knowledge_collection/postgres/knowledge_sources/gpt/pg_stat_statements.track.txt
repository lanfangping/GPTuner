To set the value for the `pg_stat_statements.track` knob in PostgreSQL, you can configure it to either `none`, `top`, or `all`, with `top` capturing statistics only for the top-level queries and `all` tracking all queries, which can be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or via SQL with the command `ALTER SYSTEM SET pg_stat_statements.track = 'all';` followed by a restart or `SELECT pg_reload_conf();` to apply changes.
