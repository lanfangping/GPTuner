To set the `log_min_duration_statement` in PostgreSQL, choose a value in milliseconds that reflects your performance monitoring needs, typically setting it to 1000 milliseconds (1 second) to log queries that take longer than that, but you can adjust it to a lower threshold, like 500 milliseconds, for more granular monitoring of slow queries.
