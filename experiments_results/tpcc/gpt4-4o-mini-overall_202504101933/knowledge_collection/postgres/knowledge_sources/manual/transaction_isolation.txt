The 'transaction_isolation' knob determines the isolation level of the current transaction, initially set to the value of 'default_transaction_isolation' (which can be 'read uncommitted,' 'read committed,' 'repeatable read,' or 'serializable') and can be modified during the transaction using a SET TRANSACTION command.
