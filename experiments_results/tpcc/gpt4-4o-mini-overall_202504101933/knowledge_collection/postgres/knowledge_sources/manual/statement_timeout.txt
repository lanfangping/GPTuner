The 'statement_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL aborts any statement that exceeds a specified time limit (default is 0 milliseconds, which disables the timeout), logging timed-out statements if 'log_min_error_statement' is set to ERROR or lower, with the timeout measured from when a command arrives until it is completed.
