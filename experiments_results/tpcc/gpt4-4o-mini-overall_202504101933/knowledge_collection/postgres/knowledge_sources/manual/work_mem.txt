The 'work_mem' knob sets the maximum memory limit for query operations like sorting or hash tables to 4MB by default (kilobytes if no units are specified), but complex queries can consume much more memory concurrently, especially for hash operations which may exceed this base limit when adjusted by the hash_mem_multiplier.
