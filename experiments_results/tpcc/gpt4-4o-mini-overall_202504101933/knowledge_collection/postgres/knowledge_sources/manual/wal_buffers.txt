The 'wal_buffers' setting determines the amount of shared memory for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data, defaulting to about 3% of shared_buffers (minimum 64kB and maximum 16MB), and can be manually configured, with values under 32kB defaulting to 32kB, while it significantly impacts write performance, especially on busy servers, when set to a few megabytes.
