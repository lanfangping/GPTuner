The 'maintenance_work_mem' parameter defines the maximum memory allocated for maintenance tasks like VACUUM and CREATE INDEX, defaulting to 64 megabytes (MB), and can be set significantly higher for better performance, while ensuring it does not exceed 1 gigabyte (GB) during VACUUM operations, and considering that autovacuum may allocate up to 'autovacuum_max_workers' times this memory.
