The 'autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age' parameter specifies that a VACUUM operation is triggered when a table's pg_class.relminmxid reaches a maximum age of 400 million multixacts to prevent multixact ID wraparound, and while it can only be set at server start, it can be reduced for individual tables.
