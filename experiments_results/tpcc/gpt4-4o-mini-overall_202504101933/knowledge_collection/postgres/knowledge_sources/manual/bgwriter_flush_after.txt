The 'bgwriter_flush_after' knob configures PostgreSQL to attempt to force OS writebacks when more than 512kB (or a user-defined value between 0 and 2MB) of data has been written by the background writer, helping to reduce transaction latency but potentially degrading performance in certain workloads.
