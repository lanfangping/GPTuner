The 'wal_level' parameter in PostgreSQL determines the volume of data written to the Write-Ahead Log, with default set to 'replica' for supporting replication and archiving, 'minimal' for the least logging which improves performance but restricts crash recovery to immediate shutdowns, and 'logical' for additional logging required for logical decoding, with each level encompassing the logging of its lower tiers; specifically, 'minimal' generates the lowest WAL volume suitable for certain scenarios, while 'logical' increases volume significantly with full row information logging for updates and deletions.
