{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `effective_io_concurrency` setting in PostgreSQL, start with a value based on your storage type: for magnetic drives, use the number of RAID 0 stripe or RAID 1 mirror drives as a starting point, while for SSDs, begin with a value of 1 and incrementally increase it, aiming for values between 100 to 200. Always monitor performance and system behavior closely during adjustments.'}
