{'suggestion': 'To effectively monitor performance in PostgreSQL, set the `log_min_duration_statement` to a specific value in milliseconds that meets your needs. For example, setting it to 250 milliseconds will log all SQL statements that take 250 milliseconds or longer, helping you identify unoptimized queries. Adjust this value according to your monitoring requirements, with a typical starting point of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) for logging slower queries.'}
