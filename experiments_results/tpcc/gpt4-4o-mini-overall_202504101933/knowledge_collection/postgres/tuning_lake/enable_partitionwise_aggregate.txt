{'suggestion': "To set the `enable_partitionwise_aggregate` parameter in PostgreSQL, you can adjust it using the command `SET enable_partitionwise_aggregate TO 'off'` for a specific session or by adding `enable_partitionwise_aggregate = off` to your `postgresql.conf` file and restarting the server. This parameter allows the query planner to perform partition-wise grouping or aggregation on partitioned tables, which may increase memory consumption linearly with the number of partitions scanned and lead to higher query planning costs."}
