{'suggestion': "To configure the `force_parallel_mode` knob in PostgreSQL, you can set it to one of three values: 'off' (the default, which allows parallel mode only for performance improvements), 'on' (enforcing parallel query execution with added Gather nodes, potentially prohibiting certain operations), or 'regress' (similar to 'on', but tailored for regression testing by hiding context lines from parallel workers and Gather nodes in EXPLAIN)."}
