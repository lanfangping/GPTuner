{'suggestion': 'To configure the `transaction_isolation` level in PostgreSQL, you can use the SQL command `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL <level>;`, where `<level>` can be one of the following: `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, or `SERIALIZABLE`, with `READ COMMITTED` being the default. This setting determines the isolation level of the current transaction and can be modified during the transaction. Additionally, you can set a default value for all sessions in the `postgresql.conf` file by adjusting `default_transaction_isolation` accordingly.'}
