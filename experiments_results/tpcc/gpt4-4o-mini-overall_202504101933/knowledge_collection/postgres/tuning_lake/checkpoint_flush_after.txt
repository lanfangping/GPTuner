{'suggestion': "Adjust the `checkpoint_flush_after` setting in PostgreSQL to 256kB on Linux (0 elsewhere) to control the forced writeback to storage during checkpoints. This setting can help reduce transaction latency by minimizing dirty data in the kernel's page cache, especially for systems with high write workloads. Monitor system performance to make further adjustments as necessary."}
