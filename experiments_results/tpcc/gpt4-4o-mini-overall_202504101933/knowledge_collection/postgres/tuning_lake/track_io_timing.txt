{'suggestion': 'To enable the `track_io_timing` parameter in PostgreSQL, set its value to `on`, as this allows for tracking of I/O timings for queries, which is beneficial for performance analysis, especially in systems with high I/O load. Be aware that this feature is off by default due to potential overhead from frequent timing queries, and its impact on performance should be assessed using the pg_test_timing tool. The relevant I/O timing data can be accessed through pg_stat_database and EXPLAIN (with BUFFERS), but only superusers have the permission to modify this setting.'}
