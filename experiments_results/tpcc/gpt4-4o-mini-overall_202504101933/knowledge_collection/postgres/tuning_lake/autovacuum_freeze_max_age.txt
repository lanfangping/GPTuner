{'suggestion': "To effectively manage transaction ID wraparound in PostgreSQL, configure the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' parameter to approximately 1 billion transactions (1,000,000,000). This setting specifies the maximum threshold for a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field, beyond which a VACUUM operation is required. You can also adjust this value for individual tables at server start to trigger autovacuum more frequently and mitigate risks."}
