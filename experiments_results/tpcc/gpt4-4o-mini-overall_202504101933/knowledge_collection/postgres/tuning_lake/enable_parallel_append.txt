{'suggestion': "To enable parallel append in PostgreSQL, ensure that the 'enable_parallel_append' parameter is set to 'on', which is enabled by default. This allows the query planner to utilize parallel-aware append plan types, improving query performance by leveraging multiple CPU cores for data retrieval. Additionally, confirm that the system's parallelism settings, such as 'max_parallel_workers' and 'max_worker_processes', are properly configured to support the desired parallel operation."}
