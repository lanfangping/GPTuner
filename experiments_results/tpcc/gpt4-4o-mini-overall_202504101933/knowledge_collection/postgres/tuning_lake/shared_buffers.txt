{'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance, set the `shared_buffers` parameter to 25% of your system's total RAM for dedicated servers with 1GB or more. It is important to note that allocating more than 40% of RAM may not yield better performance, and for larger systems, consider increasing the value to 512 (in 8kB units) or more, while ensuring the total does not exceed approximately 4096 (in 8kB units)."}
