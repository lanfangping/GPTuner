{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'synchronous_commit' setting in PostgreSQL, you can choose from several options that balance performance and data durability. The settings include: 'off' for improved write performance with potential data loss, 'local' to ensure commits are acknowledged once written to local disk, 'on' (default) for maximum durability by waiting for flush to durable storage on standbys, 'remote_write' to acknowledge writes after they are sent to synchronous standby servers, and 'remote_apply' to wait for receipt and application on standbys. This flexibility allows you to tailor the performance and safety according to your needs."}
