{'suggestion': "To set the `max_wal_size` in PostgreSQL, begin with a value of 2 MB for small databases and adjust gradually based on your system's performance and storage capacity. This parameter sets a soft limit for the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) size during automatic checkpoints, but it can temporarily exceed this limit under conditions such as heavy load or a failing archive_command, ensuring that it does not surpass the available disk space."}
