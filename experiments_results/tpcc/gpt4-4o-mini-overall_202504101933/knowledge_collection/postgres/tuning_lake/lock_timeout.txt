{'suggestion': "To configure the `lock_timeout` in PostgreSQL, use the command `SET lock_timeout = '2000ms';`, which specifies the maximum time a statement can wait to acquire a lock, applied to each lock acquisition attempt. It's important to set this timeout lower than any active `statement_timeout` to avoid redundancy. While 2000 milliseconds is a suitable default for most applications, you may adjust it based on your specific workload and performance needs, typically ranging from 1000 milliseconds to several seconds for more complex transactions."}
