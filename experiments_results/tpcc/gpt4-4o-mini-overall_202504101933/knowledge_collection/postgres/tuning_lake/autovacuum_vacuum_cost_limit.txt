{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` in PostgreSQL, set it between 2000 to 4000 as a starting point, considering that this knob defines the cost limit for automatic VACUUM operations. This limit is shared proportionally among multiple autovacuum workers to ensure their combined limits do not exceed the specified value. Adjust the setting based on workload and system performance, monitoring to achieve an effective balance between maintenance tasks and query performance.'}
