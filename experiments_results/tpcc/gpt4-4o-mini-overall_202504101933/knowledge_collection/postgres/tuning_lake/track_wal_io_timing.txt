{'suggestion': 'Set the `track_wal_io_timing` parameter in PostgreSQL to `on` to enable tracking of WAL (Write-Ahead Log) I/O timing. This can aid in analyzing performance and diagnosing I/O-related issues in high-load scenarios. However, use this setting judiciously in production environments due to the potential overhead it may introduce.'}
