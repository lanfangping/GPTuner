{'suggestion': "To optimize query performance in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to keep the `enable_indexscan` knob enabled, as it allows the query planner to utilize index-scan and index-only-scan plan types, which is beneficial for performance on large datasets. If adjustments are necessary, you can tune this setting gradually based on query performance metrics. Use `SET enable_indexscan TO 'off';` for specific sessions or `ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_indexscan TO 'off';` for a server-wide change, and carefully monitor the impact on query execution plans."}
