{'suggestion': "To set the `effective_cache_size` in PostgreSQL, configure it to approximately 75% of the total system memory available for disk caching, typically specified in blocks of 8kB. This setting influences the planner's assumption for available disk cache size for a single query, affecting the likelihood of using index scans versus sequential scans. Common values for `effective_cache_size` are around 4096 for systems with 8192 MB of RAM or 12288 for systems with 16384 MB of RAM, ensuring it reflects the actual usable memory for cache."}
