{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'deadlock_timeout' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation, which is to set the time in milliseconds that PostgreSQL waits before checking for deadlocks. 3. Research if 'deadlock_timeout' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly, such as disabling the feature or triggering a different operation. 4. Determine if the special value breaks the natural order of numerical values for this knob. 5. Conclude whether 'deadlock_timeout' is a 'special knob' based on the findings.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": null}
