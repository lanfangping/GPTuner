{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'enable_seqscan' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand that 'enable_seqscan' controls whether the query planner will use sequential scan plans or not. 3. Recognize that setting 'enable_seqscan' to 'off' (or 'false') disables sequential scans, which is a significant deviation from its normal operation where it enables or prefers sequential scans based on the query planner's decision. 4. Conclude that 'enable_seqscan' can be considered a 'special knob' because setting it to 'off' changes its behavior fundamentally, similar to how special values like -1 or 0 work in other knobs.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "off"}
