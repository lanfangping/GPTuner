{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'enable_indexscan' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its regular operation, which is to enable or disable the use of index scans for queries. 3. Recognize that setting 'enable_indexscan' to 'off' (or 'false') disables index scans, which is a different function from its regular operation of enabling index scans when set to 'on' (or 'true'). 4. Conclude that 'enable_indexscan' is a special knob because it has a special value ('off') that changes its function significantly.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
