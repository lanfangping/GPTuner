{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'synchronous_commit' in PostgreSQL. 2. Research the behavior of 'synchronous_commit' to understand its normal operation and any special values it might have. 3. Determine if 'synchronous_commit' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly from its normal operation. 4. Confirm that 'synchronous_commit' can be set to 'off' as a special value, which changes its behavior to not wait for the transaction to be written to disk before continuing, unlike its normal operation which ensures durability by waiting. 5. Classify 'synchronous_commit' as a special knob based on this behavior.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
