The `shared_buffers` parameter sets the memory used for shared memory buffers, with a default of 128MB (minimum 128KB), and for dedicated servers with ≥1GB RAM, a recommended starting value is 25% of system memory (up to 40% in some cases), while smaller systems should allocate less to preserve OS resources.
