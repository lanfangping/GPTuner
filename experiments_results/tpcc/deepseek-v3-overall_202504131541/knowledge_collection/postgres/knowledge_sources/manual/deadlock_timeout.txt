The 'deadlock_timeout' knob sets the wait time (default: 1 second, or 1000 milliseconds) before checking for deadlocks, balancing unnecessary checks with delayed error reporting, and should ideally exceed typical transaction durations; it also controls lock-wait logging when 'log_lock_waits' is enabled.
