"The 'transaction_isolation' knob sets the current transaction's isolation level (e.g., 'read committed', 'repeatable read', or 'serializable'), initially matching 'default_transaction_isolation' at transaction start, and any later changes act like a SET TRANSACTION command."  

*(Note: While the description doesn't specify numerical values, isolation levels like "read committed" (default in many databases) or "serializable" (strictest level) are concrete named states rather than numeric settings.)*
