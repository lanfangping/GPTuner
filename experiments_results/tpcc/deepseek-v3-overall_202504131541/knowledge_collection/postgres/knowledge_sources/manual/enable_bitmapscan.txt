The 'enable_bitmapscan' knob controls the query planner's use of bitmap-scan plans, with the default setting being **on (enabled)**.  

*(If more detail is needed, you could add:)*  
When enabled, it allows the planner to consider bitmap index scans, which combine multiple indexes efficiently, but can be disabled (set to **off**) for testing or optimization purposes.
