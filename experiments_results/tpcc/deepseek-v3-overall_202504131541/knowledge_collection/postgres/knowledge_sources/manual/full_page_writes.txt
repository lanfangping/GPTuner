The `full_page_writes` knob in PostgreSQL ensures data integrity by writing the entire content of each disk page (typically 8KB) to WAL during its first modification after a checkpoint, preventing partial page corruption during OS crashes, though it increases WAL volume by up to 8KB per modified page; disabling it risks data corruption but improves performance, similar to turning off `fsync`. Default is `on`.
