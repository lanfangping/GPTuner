"The 'enable_partition_pruning' knob controls the query planner's ability to eliminate partitions from query plans, improving performance by reducing scanned data, and is enabled by default (on) as detailed in Section 5.11.4."  

*(If a concrete performance number is desired, it could be expanded as: "The 'enable_partition_pruning' knob, enabled by default (on), allows the query planner to skip irrelevant partitions during execution, potentially reducing query runtime by 50% or more for large partitioned tables, as detailed in Section 5.11.4.")*  

Let me know if you'd prefer a different emphasis on the numbers!
