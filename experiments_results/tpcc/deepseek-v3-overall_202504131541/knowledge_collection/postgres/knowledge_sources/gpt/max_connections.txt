To set the `max_connections` knob in PostgreSQL, a common rule of thumb is to allocate **100 connections + (CPU cores × 10)** (e.g., 200 connections for an 8-core machine), but adjust based on workload—monitor memory usage (each connection consumes ~10MB) and avoid exceeding **80% of available RAM** or kernel limits (e.g., `ulimit -n`). For high-concurrency systems, consider connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer) to reduce overhead.
