To set the `block_size` knob in PostgreSQL, use the default value of **8KB** (8192 bytes) as it's optimized for most workloads, but consider increasing it to **16KB** or **32KB** for large sequential scans or data warehousing applications, ensuring the OS and filesystem support the chosen size (must be a power of 2 between 1KB and 32KB).
