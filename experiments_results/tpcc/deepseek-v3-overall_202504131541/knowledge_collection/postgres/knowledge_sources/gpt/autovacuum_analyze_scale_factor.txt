To set `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor`, a typical recommendation is **0.1% (0.001)** for tables with frequent updates or large data changes, balancing between avoiding unnecessary analyzes and ensuring timely statistics updates, while smaller values (e.g., **0.01% or 0.0001**) may suit very large or write-heavy tables to trigger analyzes more aggressively. Adjust based on table size and workload.
