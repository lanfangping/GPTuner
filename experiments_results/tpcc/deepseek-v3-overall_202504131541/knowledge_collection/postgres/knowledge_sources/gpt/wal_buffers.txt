To set the `wal_buffers` knob in PostgreSQL, a common recommendation is to allocate **4MB to 16MB** (or **1/32 of shared_buffers**, whichever is smaller), with PostgreSQL automatically adjusting it to a minimum of **64kB** and a maximum of **WAL segment size (typically 16MB)** if not explicitly configured. For high-WAL workloads, benchmark with **16MBâ€“32MB** for optimal performance.  

*(Example: If `shared_buffers` is 1GB, `wal_buffers` would default to ~32MB (1/32), but capping at 16MB is often sufficient.)*
