To set the `max_worker_processes` knob in PostgreSQL, allocate **1 worker per CPU core** (e.g., 8 for an 8-core server) for general parallelism, but ensure the total (including background workers and parallel query workers) does not exceed **1.5–2× CPU cores** (e.g., 12–16 for 8 cores) to avoid over-subscription, while leaving room for other processes. Adjust based on workload (e.g., **4–8 for OLTP**, **higher for analytics**).
