To set `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit`, a common starting point is **200–1000** (default: **-1**, which falls back to `vacuum_cost_limit`'s default of **200**), balancing I/O load by adjusting it higher (e.g., **1000**) if autovacuum is too slow or lower (e.g., **200–500**) if it impacts performance, while ensuring `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` (default: **2ms**) is also tuned proportionally.  

*(Note: Values depend on workload and hardware; monitor `pg_stat_progress_vacuum` to refine.)*
