To set `bgwriter_flush_after`, adjust it based on your workload: for **light workloads**, use a lower value (e.g., `64`–`128` kB), for **moderate workloads**, try `256`–`512` kB, and for **heavy write-intensive workloads**, increase it to `1MB`–`2MB` to reduce I/O pressure while avoiding excessive write bursts. Monitor performance and system I/O to fine-tune.  

*(Note: The value is in 8 kB units, so `128` = 1MB.)*
