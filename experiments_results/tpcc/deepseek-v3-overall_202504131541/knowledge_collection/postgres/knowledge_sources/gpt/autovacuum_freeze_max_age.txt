To set `autovacuum_freeze_max_age`, choose a value between **100–200 million transactions** (default: 200M), balancing aggressive freeze prevention (lower values) against autovacuum overhead (higher values), and ensure it’s **at least 20% higher than `vacuum_freeze_table_age`** (default: 150M) to avoid forced anti-wraparound vacuums. Example: `SET autovacuum_freeze_max_age = 180000000;`.
