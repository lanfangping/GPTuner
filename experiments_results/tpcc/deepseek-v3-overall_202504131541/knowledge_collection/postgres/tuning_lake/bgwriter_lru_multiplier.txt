{'suggestion': "The `bgwriter_lru_multiplier` knob in PostgreSQL should be adjusted based on the workload and monitoring of `pg_stat_bgwriter` metrics. The default value is 2.0, which provides a cushion by writing more dirty buffers than the predicted need. For high-write workloads, consider increasing the value (e.g., to 4.0-6.0) if the background writer isn't keeping up, or decrease it if it's causing unnecessary I/O overhead. The knob works by multiplying the average recent buffer demand by this value, where 1.0 writes exactly the predicted need, higher values provide a cushion, and lower values shift writes to server processes."}
