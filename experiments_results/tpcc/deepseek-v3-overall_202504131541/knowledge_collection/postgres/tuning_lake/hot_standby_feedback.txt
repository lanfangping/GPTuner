{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'Enable the `hot_standby_feedback` knob in PostgreSQL to allow standby servers to send feedback to the primary server every `wal_receiver_status_interval` (default: 10 seconds). This prevents query cancellations on the standby due to cleanup records and avoids read-only query cancellations on replicas. However, be aware that enabling this feature may lead to primary database bloat by delaying the vacuuming of dead rows and increases pressure on the master with potential for increased bloat and WAL disk space consumption. It is recommended for replication setups with high write loads or long-running queries on replicas, but consider disabling it if standby queries are short-lived or infrequent to avoid these issues.'}
