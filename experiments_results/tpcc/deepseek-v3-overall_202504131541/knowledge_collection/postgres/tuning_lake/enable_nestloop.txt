{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_nestloop' setting in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of nested-loop joins, defaulting to **on** (enabled). While it can be beneficial to disable it (`enable_nestloop = off`) for large joins (e.g., tables with >10,000 rows) to favor hash/merge joins, it should remain enabled (`enable_nestloop = on`) for small, indexed lookups (e.g., OLTP queries with <100 rows) to leverage efficient nested loop plans. Adjustments should be made based on query planner testing, keeping in mind that disabling this setting discourages but does not completely eliminate the use of nested-loop joins when alternative join methods are available."}
