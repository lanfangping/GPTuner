{'summary_suggestion': "The 'checkpoint_completion_target' in PostgreSQL should be configured to aim for completion 50% of the way through the interval between checkpoints to smooth I/O load, as this is the default and recommended setting for balancing I/O activity. However, for write-heavy workloads or development instances, adjusting this value to 0.9 can help spread writes more smoothly over time. It's important to note that while higher values like 0.9 are common in certain scenarios, keeping this value within a low percentage is advisable if you're relying on it for feeding non-streaming replicas."}
