{'suggestion': "The 'enable_indexscan' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of index-scan and index-only-scan plans, with the default setting being 'on' (enabled). It is generally recommended to leave it 'on' for most workloads. However, consider disabling it ('off') if sequential scans are faster for queries retrieving a significant portion of a table's rows or when indexes are poorly selective. The exact threshold for disabling may vary based on your specific data distribution and query patterns, so benchmarking specific queries is advised to confirm the optimal setting."}
