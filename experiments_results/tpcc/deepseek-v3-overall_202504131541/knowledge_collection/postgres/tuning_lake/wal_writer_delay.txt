{'comprehensive_suggestion': {'description': "The `wal_writer_delay` parameter in PostgreSQL specifies the sleep interval for the WAL writer between flushes, with a default value of **200ms**. This interval is used unless interrupted by an async commit, and writes are synced to disk either after the delay has passed or when the `wal_writer_flush_after`'s WAL threshold is exceeded. For optimizing performance based on workload, adjust the `wal_writer_delay`: for write-heavy systems, a lower value like **10ms** can reduce WAL flush latency, whereas for write-light systems, the default **200ms** is suitable to reduce overhead. It's important to avoid setting this value higher than **1s** to prevent checkpoint spikes.", 'values': {'default': '200ms', 'write-heavy': '10ms', 'max': '1s'}}}
