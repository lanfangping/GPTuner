{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `max_worker_processes` knob in PostgreSQL should be set to match or exceed the master server's value in standby mode, with the default being 8. It's crucial to adjust related parallel worker parameters (`max_parallel_workers`, `max_parallel_maintenance_workers`, `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`) accordingly. For optimal performance, allocate 1 worker per CPU core (e.g., 8 for an 8-core server) for general parallelism, ensuring the total does not exceed 1.5–2× CPU cores (e.g., 12–16 for 8 cores) to avoid over-subscription and leave room for other processes. Adjust based on workload, with 4–8 workers recommended for OLTP and higher for analytics. Alternatively, setting it to 75% up to 90% of the number of cores can be an easy approach, or more precisely, the sum of all worker parameters."}
