{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'max_parallel_workers' parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to a value that does not exceed 'max_worker_processes' and is adjusted in consideration of 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers' and 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' for optimal performance. A practical approach is to configure it to approximately 50-75% of the total CPU cores available on the system, ensuring that sufficient resources are left for other operations. This adjustment should be made based on the specific needs of the workload parallelism and the level of system contention."}
