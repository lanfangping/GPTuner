{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL controls the maximum memory allocated for each operation such as sorts or hash tables before spilling to disk, with a default value of 4MB which is often considered too low for modern systems. For optimal performance, it's recommended to adjust `work_mem` based on your workload: allocate **4MB–16MB per concurrent operation** (e.g., `8MB` for moderate workloads or `16MB` for complex sorts/joins), ensuring the total memory usage (`work_mem × max_worker_processes × max_connections`) does not exceed **25% of available RAM** to prevent swapping. For OLTP queries that involve simple operations, a lower setting within the MB range is sufficient, whereas OLAP-style queries may require settings in the GB range for few concurrent queries. Always monitor the performance impact of adjustments with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. It's also important to consider the potential memory consumption by multiple concurrent operations or sessions, which can consume multiples of the `work_mem` value. Starting with a value of 16MB is suggested as a good baseline for most systems, with adjustments made based on specific workload requirements and available system resources."}
