{'suggestion': "To effectively manage the 'lock_timeout' in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to abort any statement waiting longer than a specified duration to acquire a lock on a database object, with the timeout applying separately to each lock attempt, both explicit and implicit. For optimal performance, consider starting with a timeout of **100ms to 300ms** for interactive applications to prevent long waits, **1s to 5s** for batch jobs to accommodate moderate contention, or higher values like **10s to 30s** for critical operations that require complex locks. Adjust these settings based on observed lock contention and specific query requirements."}
