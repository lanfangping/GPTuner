{'suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_naptime' parameter in PostgreSQL determines the minimum delay between autovacuum runs on a database. It is recommended to set this value based on your specific needs, with the default being **60 seconds (1 minute)** for a balance between maintenance and system load. This parameter can only be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. For more aggressive cleanup, you might consider a lower value, but ensure it aligns with your workload's tolerance for maintenance delays and I/O overhead."}
