{'suggestion': "To configure the `autovacuum_work_mem` parameter effectively, it is recommended to set a value between **64MB to 1GB**, with examples such as `128MB` for moderate workloads or `512MB` for large tables, ensuring it does not exceed the available system memory or negatively impact other processes. It's important to note that autovacuum is inherently capped at **1GB** for dead tuple collection, making values above this threshold ineffective for that specific purpose. Adjustments should be made based on monitoring autovacuum performance and system resource usage. For implementation, you can set this parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file (e.g., `SET autovacuum_work_mem = '128MB';`). This approach balances the need for efficient autovacuum operations with system resource constraints, taking into account the default behavior where `autovacuum_work_mem` inherits from `maintenance_work_mem` if not explicitly set."}
