{'suggestion': {'description': "The 'hot_standby' knob in PostgreSQL should be enabled ('on') for standby servers to allow read-only queries during recovery, with no performance penalty, and it is irrelevant on primary servers. This parameter is a boolean ('on'/'off') and does not require numeric tuning. It is important to note that the 'hot_standby' knob can only be configured at server startup and defaults to 'on'."}}
