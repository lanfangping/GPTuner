{'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL performance, the 'commit_siblings' knob should be set based on the system's workload. The default value is **5**, which is suitable for general workloads. However, on high-concurrency systems with many concurrent transactions, increasing this value to **10â€“20** can help reduce contention by delaying commit delays when at least that many sibling transactions are active. This adjustment should be made based on observed lock contention and throughput. The knob essentially sets the minimum number of concurrent open transactions required before triggering the commit_delay, thereby increasing the likelihood of another transaction being ready to commit during the delay."}
