{'suggestion': "The 'default_transaction_isolation' knob in PostgreSQL is used to set the default isolation level for new transactions. The available options are 'read uncommitted', 'read committed' (which is the default), 'repeatable read', or 'serializable'. This setting can be configured either by editing the 'postgresql.conf' file or by using the 'SET' command, for example, 'SET default_transaction_isolation = 'repeatable read';'. For more detailed information, refer to Chapter 13 and the SET TRANSACTION command in the PostgreSQL documentation."}
