{'summary_suggestion': {'description': "The `full_page_writes` knob in PostgreSQL is crucial for data integrity by writing the entire content of each disk page to WAL during its first modification after a checkpoint, preventing partial page corruption during OS crashes. While disabling it (`full_page_writes = off`) can offer a performance boost, especially on systems with atomic writes like battery-backed RAID or ZFS with `sync=always`, it risks data corruption on standard systems. Therefore, it is recommended to leave it enabled (`full_page_writes = on`, the default) for safety, unless you are certain of your storage system's capability to prevent partial-page corruption after crashes."}}
