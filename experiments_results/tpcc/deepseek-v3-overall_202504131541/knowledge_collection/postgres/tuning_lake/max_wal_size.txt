{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'max_wal_size' parameter in PostgreSQL sets a soft limit for WAL growth during automatic checkpoints, with a default of 1 GB. This limit can be exceeded under heavy load or special conditions. To optimize performance, it is recommended to adjust this value based on your system's workload: start with 1GB (or 10% of shared_buffers, whichever is larger) for smaller workloads and consider scaling up to 4GB or more for high-write systems, ensuring it does not exceed half of the available storage space dedicated to WAL. Increasing 'max_wal_size' can help ensure that automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout rather than disk space, though it may prolong recovery time after a crash. Monitor checkpoint behavior to dynamically adjust the setting, aiming for checkpoint intervals of 15-30 minutes."}
