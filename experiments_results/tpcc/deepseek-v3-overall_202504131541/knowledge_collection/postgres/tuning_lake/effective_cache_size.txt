{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `effective_cache_size` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set based on the planner's assumption about the available disk cache for a query, influencing the decision between index and sequential scans by estimating the cache size. This includes PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel's disk cache, adjusted if `BLCKSZ` differs from 8kB. For a more precise calculation, it can be set to approximately: system RAM - (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) * 1.1, especially if the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL. Alternatively, allocating 50-75% of the system's total RAM (e.g., 8GB for a 16GB RAM machine) is recommended, ensuring it accounts for the OS and other processes without exceeding the OS's file cache capacity. The priority is to follow the manual_suggestion's detailed explanation of the parameter's purpose and impact, supplemented by the web_suggestion's formula for dedicated servers, while the gpt_suggestion provides a general guideline for RAM allocation."}
