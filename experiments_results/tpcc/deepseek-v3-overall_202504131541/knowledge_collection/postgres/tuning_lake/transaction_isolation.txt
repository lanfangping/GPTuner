{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure the 'transaction_isolation' in PostgreSQL, you can set the isolation level for the current transaction using 'SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL <value>', where <value> can be 'read committed' (the default level that balances consistency and performance), 'repeatable read' (to prevent non-repeatable reads), or 'serializable' (the strictest level ensuring full isolation but may impact throughput). The initial isolation level of a transaction matches the 'default_transaction_isolation' setting at the transaction's start, and any subsequent changes to the isolation level within the transaction will act as if a 'SET TRANSACTION' command was issued. This setting can also be predefined in the 'postgresql.conf' file by specifying 'default_transaction_isolation = 'desired_level''."}
