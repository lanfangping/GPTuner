{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To configure the 'shared_preload_libraries' in PostgreSQL, specify a comma-separated list of necessary extensions (e.g., 'pg_stat_statements, auto_explain'), ensuring the total size does not exceed the 'shared_buffers' limit, which is typically 25-40% of available RAM (e.g., 4GB for a 16GB system). This setting is crucial for libraries that require postmaster-start operations, such as shared memory allocation, and necessitates a server restart for changes to take effect. Note that this configuration slightly increases new process startup time and is not suitable for temporary debuggingâ€”consider using 'session_preload_libraries' for such purposes. On Windows, while preloading does not reduce process startup time due to each process reloading libraries, it remains essential for postmaster-start operations. Adjust the extensions and 'shared_buffers' proportion based on your specific workload and system resources."}
