{'suggestion': 'For the `wal_sync_method` knob in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to set it to `fdatasync` as it is the default on most systems, including Linux and FreeBSD, unless benchmarking indicates better performance with alternatives such as `fsync`, `open_sync`, or `open_datasync`. While `fdatasync` typically achieves 5,000â€“15,000 transactions per second (TPS), alternatives like `open_sync` may offer higher performance (up to 20,000+ TPS) but come with increased risks of data corruption in the event of power loss. The choice should be based on a careful consideration of the trade-offs between durability and performance. Note that `fsync_writethrough` ensures write-through caching but may negatively impact performance, and the default setting can vary by platform.'}
