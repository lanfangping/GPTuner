{'suggestion': "The 'enable_hashagg' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of hashed aggregation plans, with the default setting being 'on' (enabled). It is recommended to enable it ('on' or 'true') for large aggregations (e.g., >10,000 rows) to leverage hash-based aggregation for better performance, or disable it ('off' or 'false') for small datasets (e.g., <1,000 rows) where sorting may be faster due to lower overhead. Adjustments should be based on query plans and testing."}
