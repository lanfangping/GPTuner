{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `maintenance_work_mem` knob in PostgreSQL should be set to improve performance for maintenance operations such as VACUUM and CREATE INDEX. The default setting is **64MB**, but it can be safely increased up to **1GB** for tasks like dead tuple collection to enhance performance. However, caution is advised when adjusting this value in environments using autovacuum, as the total memory usage will multiply by the number of `autovacuum_max_workers`. For systems with large RAM resources, allocating approximately **5% of total system RAM** (e.g., **1GB for a 20GB RAM server**) is recommended, but it should generally be kept below **2GB** unless performing large maintenance tasks like VACUUM FULL or index creation, where values up to **4GBâ€“8GB** may be justified for high-memory systems. Adjustments should be based on the workload: smaller values for frequent small operations and larger values for bulk operations. Note that unless directly controlled by `autovacuum_work_mem`, this setting also determines the amount of memory each autovacuum worker might use.'}
