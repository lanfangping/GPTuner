{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `shared_buffers` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to allocate memory for shared memory buffers. For dedicated servers with 1GB RAM or more, a recommended starting value is 25% of system memory, which can be adjusted up to 40% in some cases. It's important to leave sufficient RAM for filesystem caching and other PostgreSQL workloads. For systems with hundreds of GBs of RAM, consider setting up huge pages. Additionally, this parameter is related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. Always perform your own benchmarks to fine-tune this setting, especially on non-dedicated servers where other services may compete for memory."}
