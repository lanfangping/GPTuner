{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_hashjoin' knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of hash-join operations, with the default setting being on (enabled). It is recommended to enable it ('on' or 'true') for queries that benefit from hash joins, such as large table joins with equality conditions, or disable it ('off' or 'false') to force alternative plans like nested loops for small tables or merge joins for sorted data. Benchmarking should be conducted to confirm any performance gains, for example, using 'SET enable_hashjoin = on;' might result in a 20% speedup in specific workloads."}
