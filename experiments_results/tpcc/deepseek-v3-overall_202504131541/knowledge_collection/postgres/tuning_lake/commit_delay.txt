{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimize the `commit_delay` knob in PostgreSQL, it's recommended to introduce a delay (default: 0 microseconds, configurable in µs) before initiating a WAL flush. This adjustment improves group commit throughput when at least `commit_siblings` transactions are active, though it may increase latency by up to the delay duration. For high-throughput OLTP systems, starting with a delay of 10–100 microseconds and incrementally increasing it (e.g., by 10µs) while monitoring performance is advisable. Ensure the delay does not exceed `commit_siblings`-scaled thresholds (e.g., delay = `commit_siblings` × 1µs) and avoid excessive delays (e.g., >1ms) to prevent noticeable transaction latency. Note that `commit_delay` is only effective if `commit_siblings` (default: 5) concurrent transactions are active."}
