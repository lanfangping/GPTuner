{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' parameter is crucial for determining when to trigger an ANALYZE operation by adding a percentage of a table's size to 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold'. The default setting is 10% (0.1), but for tables with frequent updates or large data changes, adjusting this to a lower value such as 0.1% (0.001) can help balance between avoiding unnecessary analyzes and ensuring timely statistics updates. For very large or write-heavy tables, even smaller values like 0.01% (0.0001) may be more appropriate to trigger analyzes more aggressively. This parameter can be adjusted globally in postgresql.conf or specified per-table via storage parameters, allowing for flexibility based on specific table sizes and workloads."}
