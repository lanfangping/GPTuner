{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL controls the maximum memory allocated for each operation such as sorts or hash tables before spilling to disk, with a default value of 4MB which is often considered too low for modern systems. For optimal performance, it's recommended to adjust `work_mem` based on your workload: allocate **4MB–16MB per concurrent operation** (e.g., `8MB` for moderate workloads or `16MB` for complex sorts/joins), ensuring the total memory usage (`work_mem × max_worker_processes × max_connections`) does not exceed **25% of available RAM** to prevent swapping. For OLTP queries that involve simple operations, a lower setting within the MB range is sufficient, whereas OLAP-style queries may require settings in the GB range for few concurrent queries. Always monitor the performance impact of adjustments with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. It's also important to consider the potential memory consumption by multiple concurrent operations or sessions, which can consume multiples of the `work_mem` value. Starting with a value of 16MB is suggested as a good baseline for most systems, with adjustments made based on specific workload requirements and available system resources."}

It's crucial to adjust related parallel worker parameters (`max_parallel_workers`, `max_parallel_maintenance_workers`, `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`) accordingly. For optimal performance, allocate 1 worker per CPU core (e.g., 8 for an 8-core server) for general parallelism, ensuring the total does not exceed 1.5–2× CPU cores (e.g., 12–16 for 8 cores) to avoid over-subscription and leave room for other processes. Adjust based on workload, with 4–8 workers recommended for OLTP and higher for analytics. Alternatively, setting it to 75% up to 90% of the number of cores can be an easy approach, or more precisely, the sum of all worker parameters."}

It's important to note that autovacuum is inherently capped at **1GB** for dead tuple collection, making values above this threshold ineffective for that specific purpose.

In high throughput OLTP systems, it's often better to limit this setting to 1 or 2 to avoid excessive resource consumption, whereas for analytical or data warehousing systems, a higher value, as a fraction of cores, may be beneficial. Each additional worker can significantly increase resource usage (e.g., 4 workers may consume up to 5x more CPU, memory, and I/O), so adjustments should be based on workload concurrency and monitoring.

It's important to monitor system performance and I/O to adjust accordingly. Remember, the value is in 8 kB units (e.g., `128` = 1MB).

{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_max_workers' parameter sets the maximum number of autovacuum processes (excluding the launcher) that can run simultaneously, with a default value of 3, and it can only be configured at server startup. For optimal performance, consider allocating 1 worker per CPU core (up to 3-5 workers) for moderate workloads, or 5-8 workers for high-churn systems with many tables, ensuring it doesn’t exceed 'max_worker_processes' (default: 8) and leaves resources for other tasks. Adjust based on I/O capacity, where SSDs can support more workers than HDDs. Example configurations include 4 workers for 4-core systems, scaling to 6-8 for large databases. Monitoring 'pg_stat_activity' and autovacuum delays is recommended to fine-tune the setting."}
