{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'enable_sort' in PostgreSQL. 2. Research if 'enable_sort' has any special values that deviate from its numerical ordering. 3. Determine if setting 'enable_sort' to a special value (like -1 or 0) changes its functionality significantly, such as disabling the feature. 4. If such a special value exists, classify 'enable_sort' as a 'special knob'. 5. If no such special value exists, classify it as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "0"}
