{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'vacuum_cost_delay' in PostgreSQL. 2. Research the function and possible values of 'vacuum_cost_delay'. 3. Determine if 'vacuum_cost_delay' has any special values that deviate from its regular numerical operation. 4. Confirm if setting 'vacuum_cost_delay' to a special value (like -1 or 0) changes its function significantly, such as disabling a feature. 5. Classify 'vacuum_cost_delay' based on the findings.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "0"}
