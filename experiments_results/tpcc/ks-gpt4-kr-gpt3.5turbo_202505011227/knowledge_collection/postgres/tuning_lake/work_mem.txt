{'suggestion': "When configuring the 'work_mem' parameter for query operations in your database, it is essential to strike a balance between memory usage and performance impact. For OLTP queries without complex joins, a low MB value may suffice, while OLAP-style queries with fewer concurrent operations may require values in the GB range. It is recommended to adjust the 'work_mem' parameter based on the memory usage observed in queries. Consider increasing the default value of 4MB, with suggestions like 16MB being a good starting point for most systems. Keep in mind that setting 'work_mem' too low can lead to performance issues, while setting it too high may destabilize node throughput under heavy concurrent operations."}
