{'suggestion': {'summary': "When setting the value for the 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob in Postgres, consider using a default value of 15 milliseconds per page modified during POST vacuum to improve performance. However, adjust the value based on the specific workload and query patterns of your database. For busy systems, reducing the value to increase background writer activity is recommended. Values should ideally be in multiples of 10ms, but the knob should generally specify a time less than 1 millisecond for optimal cost-based vacuuming."}}
