{'suggestion': "To manage the autovacuum process in PostgreSQL effectively, ensure that the 'autovacuum' knob is configured in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. This feature is enabled by default but requires track_counts to be enabled as well. Additionally, consider disabling autovacuuming for specific tables by adjusting the storage parameters."}
