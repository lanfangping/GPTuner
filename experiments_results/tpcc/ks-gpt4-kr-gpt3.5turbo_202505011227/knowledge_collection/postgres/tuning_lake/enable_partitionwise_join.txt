{'suggestion': "Enabling the 'enable_partitionwise_join' knob allows the query planner to use partitionwise join for joining partitioned tables. This feature can improve query performance by reducing data movement across partitions and enhancing parallelism. However, it may lead to increased memory consumption and query planning costs, so it's recommended to carefully evaluate the trade-offs before enabling this option."}
