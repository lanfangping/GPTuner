{'suggestion': "Set the 'effective_cache_size' parameter in PostgreSQL to a value calculated as system RAM minus (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) multiplied by 1.1, ensuring to lower the value if the server is not solely dedicated to PostgreSQL. This parameter influences the planner's assumption about the disk cache size available for queries, affecting the preference between index scans and sequential scans. The default value of 'effective_cache_size' is 4 gigabytes."}
