{'suggestion': "Consider adjusting the 'checkpoint_timeout' parameter in PostgreSQL to potentially impact crash recovery time. Normally, raising this parameter can lead to larger I/O spikes and longer recovery time after a database crash. However, increasing it can also improve overall I/O usage, as more frequent checkpoints reduce the risk of data loss and enhance system stability."}
