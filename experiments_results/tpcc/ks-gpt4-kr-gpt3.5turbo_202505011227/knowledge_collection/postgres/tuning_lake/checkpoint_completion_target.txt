{'suggestion': "To optimize the completion of checkpoints in your database, consider raising the 'checkpoint_completion_target' value to smooth I/O activity over larger periods of time. It is recommended to keep this value within a low percentage if used for non-streaming replicas. Typically, on development instances, setting it to '0.9' is common practice."}
