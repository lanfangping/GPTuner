{'suggestion': "To optimize performance in PostgreSQL, consider using the 'statement_timeout' knob to automatically abort statements exceeding a specified time limit in milliseconds. It's important to note that setting this parameter in postgresql.conf may impact all sessions, so caution is advised. Additionally, ensure that log_min_error_statement is configured appropriately to log timed-out statements for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes."}
