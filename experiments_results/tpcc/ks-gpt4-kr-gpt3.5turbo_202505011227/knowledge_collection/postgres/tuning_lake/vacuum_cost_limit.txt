{'suggestion': "Consider raising the 'vacuum_cost_limit' parameter to improve I/O usage by potentially reducing recovery time after a database crash. A higher value can lead to larger I/O spikes but may enhance performance overall. The 'vacuum_cost_limit' knob determines the threshold for the vacuuming process to pause based on the accumulated cost."}
