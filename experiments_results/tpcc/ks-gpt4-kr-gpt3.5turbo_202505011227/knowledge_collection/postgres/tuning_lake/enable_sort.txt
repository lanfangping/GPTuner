{'suggestion': "Consider adjusting the 'enable_sort' knob to optimize query planning. Enabling this knob allows the query planner to use explicit sort steps, which can improve performance in certain scenarios. However, if there are alternative methods available, turning it off may discourage the planner from using sort operations. The default setting is usually set to on, but you may want to experiment with this setting based on your specific use case and performance requirements."}
