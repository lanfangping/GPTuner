{'suggestion': "Consider adjusting the 'bgwriter_flush_after' parameter to optimize the background writer's behavior. This parameter dictates when the background writer triggers the OS to write data to storage. The default value is 512kB on Linux and 0 elsewhere. Modifying this parameter can potentially decrease transaction latency, although it might impact performance in specific workloads. Evaluate the system's requirements and workload characteristics to determine the most suitable value for 'bgwriter_flush_after'."}
