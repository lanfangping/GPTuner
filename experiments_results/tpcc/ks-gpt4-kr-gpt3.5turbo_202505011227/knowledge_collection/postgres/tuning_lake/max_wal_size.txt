{'suggestion': "To optimize the performance and reliability of the database, consider adjusting the 'max_wal_size' parameter in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. Unless disk space constraints are a concern, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure that automatic checkpoints are primarily triggered by timeout rather than by disk space limitations. By increasing 'max_wal_size', the recovery time after a database crash may be extended, but it can help prevent issues related to insufficient Write-Ahead Log capacity during checkpoints."}
