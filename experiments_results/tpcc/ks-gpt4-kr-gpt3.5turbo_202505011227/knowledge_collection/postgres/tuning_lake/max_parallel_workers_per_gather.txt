{'suggestion': 'When configuring the max_parallel_workers_per_gather setting in PostgreSQL, it is important to consider the specific workload type. For high throughput OLTP systems, it is advisable to keep the value low, ideally at 1 or 2, to avoid resource consumption. However, for analytical or data warehousing systems, the setting can be increased to a fraction of the available cores. It is recommended to review and adjust the value of work_mem accordingly to optimize performance. Careful consideration should be given to enabling parallel query execution, as it can significantly increase resource usage compared to non-parallel queries.'}
