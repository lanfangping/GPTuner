{'suggestion': "To optimize database performance, consider adjusting the 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' parameter to control when ANALYZE operations are triggered. If disk space is not a concern, increase this value to ensure that automatic checkpoints are mainly caused by timeout rather than disk space limitations, even though a higher value may lead to longer recovery times after a database crash."}
