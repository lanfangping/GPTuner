The max_parallel_workers_per_gather setting determines the maximum number of workers that can be started by a single Gather or Gather Merge node, with the default value being 2 and the option to disable parallel query execution by setting it to 0, but it should be used carefully as parallel queries may consume substantially more resources than non-parallel queries.
