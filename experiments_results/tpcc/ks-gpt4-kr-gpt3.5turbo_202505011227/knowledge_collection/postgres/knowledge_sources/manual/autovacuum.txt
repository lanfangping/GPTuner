The 'autovacuum' knob controls the autovacuum launcher daemon in PostgreSQL, which is enabled by default but requires track_counts to also be enabled in order to work, and can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line, with the option to disable autovacuuming for individual tables by changing storage parameters.
