To set the value for the 'effective_cache_size' knob in Postgres, start by calculating the total amount of RAM available on the server and allocating a portion of it (typically around 50-75%) to the parameter. For example, if the server has 16GB of RAM, setting 'effective_cache_size' to 8GB (or 8192MB) may be a good starting point.
