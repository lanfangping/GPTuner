{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_partitionwise_join' controls whether partition-wise joins are allowed in PostgreSQL. It is a numerical setting that can typically be set to 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled). The value of 0 disables the feature, which indicates that it behaves differently at this point. Therefore, it can be classified as a special knob because it has a special value (0) that changes its function.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
