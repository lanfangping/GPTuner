{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' in PostgreSQL controls the minimum number of tuple updates or deletions required before a vacuum operation is triggered for a table. It is a numerical value that usually has a natural order (higher values mean more tuples are needed for vacuuming). The knob does not have specific special values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a different function or disable the feature. Therefore, it behaves as a regular numerical knob without any special cases.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
