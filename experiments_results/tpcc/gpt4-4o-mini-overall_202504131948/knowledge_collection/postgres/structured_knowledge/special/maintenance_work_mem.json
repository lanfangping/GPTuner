{"think_procedure": "The knob 'maintenance_work_mem' in PostgreSQL is used to set the amount of memory to be used for maintenance operations, such as VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY. It is a numerical value that determines how much memory is allocated for these operations. The default value is typically set to a certain amount of memory (e.g., 64MB). There are no special values like -1 or 0 that change its function to disable features. Instead, it simply allocates memory for maintenance tasks. Therefore, it does not break the natural order of numerical values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
