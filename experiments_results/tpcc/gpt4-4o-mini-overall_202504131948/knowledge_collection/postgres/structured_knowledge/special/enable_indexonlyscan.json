{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_indexonlyscan' controls whether index-only scans are allowed in PostgreSQL. This feature can significantly improve performance by allowing the database to retrieve data directly from the index without accessing the table. The default value is 'true', which means index-only scans are enabled. If set to 'false', index-only scans are disabled. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that change its fundamental operation; it simply toggles the feature on or off. Therefore, it does not exhibit the characteristics of a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
