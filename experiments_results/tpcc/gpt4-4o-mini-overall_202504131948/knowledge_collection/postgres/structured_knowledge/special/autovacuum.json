{"think_procedure": "The autovacuum knob in PostgreSQL controls the automatic vacuuming of tables to reclaim storage and maintain database performance. It does not have a natural order in the same way that numerical knobs do, as it typically is set to a boolean value (on/off) rather than a numerical range. However, it does not have special values like -1 or 0 that break the natural order; instead, it simply enables or disables functionality. Therefore, it does not qualify as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
