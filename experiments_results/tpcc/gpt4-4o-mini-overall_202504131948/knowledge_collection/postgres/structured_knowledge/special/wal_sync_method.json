Check if the knob can be set to values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a special condition. 4. Since 'wal_sync_method' can be set to specific methods of synchronization, it does not have special values like -1 or 0 that would change its behavior drastically. 5. Conclude that it behaves as a regular numerical knob without special conditions.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
