{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_max_workers' controls the maximum number of autovacuum worker processes that can run concurrently. It is a numerical setting that typically has a natural order, as higher values allow more workers to run. However, it does not have any special values like -1 or 0 that would disable the feature or change its behavior significantly. Therefore, it does not break the natural order and functions as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
