{"think_procedure": "The knob 'default_transaction_isolation' in PostgreSQL sets the default isolation level for transactions. It can take values like 'read committed', 'repeatable read', 'serializable', and 'read uncommitted'. These values have a natural order in terms of isolation levels. However, it does not have a special value like -1 or 0 that alters its fundamental function. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob without any special operations associated with specific values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
