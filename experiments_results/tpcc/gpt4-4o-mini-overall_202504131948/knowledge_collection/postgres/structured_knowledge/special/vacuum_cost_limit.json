{"think_procedure": "The vacuum_cost_limit knob in PostgreSQL controls the cost limit for vacuum operations. It is a numerical setting that determines how much work can be done by vacuuming before the system pauses to allow other operations. This knob does not have a special value like -1 or 0 that alters its function. Therefore, it follows a natural order of numerical values and is not classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
