{"think_procedure": "The knob 'enable_parallel_append' in PostgreSQL controls whether parallel append operations are allowed. It is a numerical knob that typically accepts values like 0 or 1, where 0 disables the feature and 1 enables it. Since 0 is a special value that changes the behavior of the knob significantly (disabling parallel append), it qualifies as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
