{"think_procedure": "The knob 'wal_writer_flush_after' in PostgreSQL controls the behavior of the write-ahead log (WAL) writer. It specifies the amount of time the WAL writer will wait before flushing data to disk. The default value is typically set to a specific time in milliseconds, which is a regular numerical value. However, if this knob is set to -1, it disables the WAL writer flushing, which is a special behavior. Therefore, since -1 is a special value that changes the normal operation of the knob, it qualifies as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
