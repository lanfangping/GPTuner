For instance, on a system with 16GB of RAM, a setting of 1024 kB is appropriate, but ensure that you adjust this value according to your system's capacity and workload to avoid excessive memory usage. Additionally, be aware that the autovacuum process may increase memory allocation based on the number of autovacuum workers, so consider this when configuring the setting."}

{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL, begin with a value of 16MB, which is generally considered a good starting point for most scenarios. This parameter sets the maximum memory limit for query operations, such as sorting and hash tables, and should be adjusted based on the complexity of your queries and the number of concurrent sessions. For OLTP queries with simple operations, a lower value in the low MBs may suffice, while for OLAP queries, particularly with fewer concurrent operations, it can be increased into the GB range. Be mindful that if the memory allocated is insufficient, PostgreSQL will resort to using disk, which can negatively impact performance. Conversely, setting it too high may destabilize node throughput under heavy concurrency. To estimate the total potential memory consumed, consider the formula: max_connections * N, where N is a small single-digit number. Adjust the `work_mem` value according to your memory resources and query patterns.'}
