            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            KNOB: maintenance_work_mem
            SUGGESTION: {'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL maintenance operations, set the `maintenance_work_mem` value to allocate a significant portion of your system's RAM, ideally about 10-20% of total RAM, to enhance the performance of tasks like VACUUM and CREATE INDEX.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

Database Management Systems (DBMS) have settings referred to as 'knobs'. Numerical knobs typically have a natural order. However, some 'special' numerical knobs have special values, such as -1 or 0, that break this natural order. When set to a special value, such knob performs a very different function compared to its regular operation, such as disabling a feature. Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob. Let us think step by step, please classify a knob of postgresas a 'special knob' and provide the RESULT in JSON format.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000".

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

            SUGGESTION: {'suggestion': 'To optimize the `work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL, begin with a value of 16MB, which is generally considered a good starting point for most scenarios. This parameter sets the maximum memory limit for query operations, such as sorting and hash tables, and should be adjusted based on the complexity of your queries and the number of concurrent sessions. For OLTP queries with simple operations, a lower value in the low MBs may suffice, while for OLAP queries, particularly with fewer concurrent operations, it can be increased into the GB range. Be mindful that if the memory allocated is insufficient, PostgreSQL will resort to using disk, which can negatively impact performance. Conversely, setting it too high may destabilize node throughput under heavy concurrency.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS:

- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting.

Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.

Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.

            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

"min_value": null,

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

            <example>
KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.

Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:

Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.

Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

Database Management Systems (DBMS) have settings referred to as 'knobs'. Numerical knobs typically have a natural order. However, some 'special' numerical knobs have special values, such as -1 or 0, that break this natural order. When set to a special value, such knob performs a very different function compared to its regular operation, such as disabling a feature. Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],
"min_value": "100,000",
"max_value": "2,000,000,000"

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "16 MB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB:autovacuum_freeze_max_age
SUGGESTIONS:
I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' value between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is initiated to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, it's recommended to keep this value within 500,000 to avoid aggressive autovacuuming, which can negatively impact performance. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended range as "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers two recommended range rather. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". Note that two ranges are offered, but one upper bound(500,000) is contained in the range "between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000" and "within 500,000". So it would be nice to put "500,000" in suggested_values. Since no unit is mentioned, we assume it's a unitless value. 
Step 6: The larger recommended range is ""between 100,000 to 2,000,000,000", so we set "100,000" as "min_value", set "2,000,000,000" as "max_value"
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
"suggested_values": ["500,000"],

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.

            Suppose you are an experienced DBA, and you are required to tune a knob of postgres.

            TASK DESCRIPTION:
            Given the knob name along with its suggestion and hardware information, your job is to offer three values that may lead to the best performance of the system and meet the hardware resource constraints. The three values you need to provide are 'suggested_values', 'min_values', and 'max_values'. If you can identify one or more exact discrete suggested values, treat them as 'suggested_values'. If the suggested values fall within a continuous interval, provide the 'min_value' and 'max_value' for that interval.

            Note that the result you provide should be derived or inferred from the information provided. The result values should be numerical, and if a unit is needed, you can only choose from [KB, MB, GB, ms, s, min]; other units are not permitted.

            The question you need to solve will be given in the HTML tag <question>, the suggested steps to follow to finish the job are in <step>, and some examples will be given in the <example> tag.

            <step>
            Step 1: Check if the suggestion provides values for the knob; if so, identify the relevant sentences and move to Step 2. If not, move to Step 2. Note that there may be several sentences you should try to find them all.
            Step 2: Check if the suggestion recommends some values related to hardware information. If so, proceed to Step 3; if not, proceed to Step 4.
            Step 3: Read the hardware information to figure out the hardware-relevent value(s); some easy computation may be required.
            Step 4: Check whether the suggestion offers a specific recommended value or a recommended range for good performance or both of them. Note that sometimes the default value or the permitted value range of the knob is given, but these are not the recommended values for optimal DBMS performance, so ignore these values.
            Step 5: If discrete suggested values are given, list them under 'suggested_values'.
            Step 6: If a suggested range is given, set the upper and lower bounds of the range as the 'max_value' and 'min_value', respectively.
            Step 7: Return the result in JSON format.

KNOB: vacuum_cost_delay
SUGGESTIONS: 
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob can be set to a value between 0 and 100 milliseconds, where a lower value will make the vacuum process faster but consume more resources, while a higher value will slow down the vacuum process but consume fewer resources.
- The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process, measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value of zero disabling the cost-based vacuum delay feature, and positive values enabling it; optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond, but larger delays may not be accurately measured on older platforms.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "optimal values are typically less than 1 millisecond." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 6: The range is "less than 1 millisecond." Only the upper bound of the recommended range is given. Since the unit is millisecond, which corresponds to "ms" in the permitted units, set "1 ms" as "max_value". Although we can infer that the lower bound permitted for the knob is 0, the recommended lower bound is not given, so leave it alone.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{{
"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "1 ms"
}}

KNOB: shared_buffers
SUGGESTION:
The 'shared_buffers' parameter determines the amount of memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. It's advisable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate to leave adequate space for the operating system. However, any larger settings would necessitate an increase in 'max_wal_size'. Remember that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations and this variable is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. It's also recommended to conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter and adjust accordingly, especially for non-dedicated servers.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion provides values for the knob 'shared_buffers'. It suggests setting 'shared_buffers' to 25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM, but not exceeding 40% to allow PostgreSQL to rely on the operating system cache. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage is appropriate. Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The suggestion recommends values related to hardware information, specifically the system's memory. Proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information indicates that the machine has a RAM of 110 GB. Therefore, the 'shared_buffers' parameter should be set to 25% of 110 GB, which is 27.5 GB, but not exceeding 40% of 110 GB, which is 44 GB.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended discrete value as "25% of the system's memory for systems with 1GB or more RAM," and a range for good performance, which is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory.  
Step 5: 25% of the system's memory is proposed as a discrete suggested value. Therefore, "27.5 GB" is put into the "suggested_values".
Step 6: The suggested range is not exceeding 40% of the system's memory. Therefore, the the 'max_value' is "44 GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format. The result is:
{
"suggested_values": ["27.5 GB"],
"min_value": null,
"max_value": "44 GB"
}

KNOB: max_wal_size
SUGGESTIONS:
Based on the workload and available disk space, it is suggested to adjust the 'max_wal_size' value. Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more. However, unless there are disk space constraints, it is recommended to raise this value to ensure automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. It's important to note that the 'max_wal_size' parameter controls the maximum size the WAL can grow during automatic checkpoints, with a soft limit default of 1 GB, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Be aware that increasing this parameter may extend the time required for crash recovery.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB, but for heavier workloads, it can be increased to 4GB or more." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is not related to hardware information; proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion recommends two specific discrete values as "Typically, this is set to about 1GB" and "it can be increased to 4GB or more." Note that "4 GB" does not provide a bound of a range, so it should be a suggested_value. No suggested range is given.
Step 5: No suggested range is given.
Step 6: The discrete suggested values are "1GB" and "4GB".
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:
{
    "suggested_values": ["1 GB", "4 GB"],
    "min_value": null,
    "max_value": null
}

KNOB: wal_buffers
SUGGESTIONS：
It is suggested to manually set the 'wal_buffers' value, which refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk. This value impacts write performance, especially on busy servers. Ideally, it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB. The default setting is -1, which equates to roughly 3% of shared_buffers. However, it should not be less than 64kB, and values less than 32kB are treated as 32kB. This setting determines the number of disk-page buffers dedicated to caching write-ahead log information.

ANS:
Step 1: The suggestion offers a recommended value as "it should be set to 1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." Proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The knob is related to hardware information; proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: The hardware information is given, but it is not directly related to the suggested value. The suggested value is related to another knob, 'shared_buffers', not the hardware. So, we cannot figure out the suggested value from the hardware information. Proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: The suggestion offers a recommended range rather than specific discrete values. Proceed to Step 5.
Step 5: The range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers, but not more than 16MB." The lower bound of the recommended range is "1/32nd of shared_buffers", and the upper bound is "16MB". Since the unit is MB, which corresponds to "MB" in the permitted units, set "16 MB" as "max_value". The lower bound is related to another knob, so we cannot provide a specific numerical value. Leave it alone.
Step 6: No discrete suggested values are given.
Step 7: Return the result in JSON format, i.e.:

"suggested_values": [],
"min_value": null,
