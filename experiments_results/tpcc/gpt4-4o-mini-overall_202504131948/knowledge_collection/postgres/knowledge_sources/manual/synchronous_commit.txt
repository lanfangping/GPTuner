The 'synchronous_commit' knob in PostgreSQL controls the level of Write Ahead Logging (WAL) processing required before confirming a transaction's success to the client, with modes including 'on' (default), 'off', 'local', 'remote_write', and 'remote_apply', where 'off' allows immediate acknowledgment at the risk of delayed durability (up to a maximum of three times the 'wal_writer_delay'), and 'remote_apply' ensures both commitment and application of changes on standby servers before response, potentially leading to significantly longer delays.
