The knob 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' determines that an ANALYZE will be triggered when the number of modified rows exceeds 10% of the table size, as it adds a fraction of 0.1 to the autovacuum_analyze_threshold, and while it can only be configured in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line, it can be overridden for specific tables using their storage parameters.
