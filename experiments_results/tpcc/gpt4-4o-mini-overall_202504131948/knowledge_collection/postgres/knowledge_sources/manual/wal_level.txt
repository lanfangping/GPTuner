The 'wal_level' parameter in PostgreSQL controls the amount of information written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL), with possible settings being 'minimal' for the least logging, 'replica' for supporting WAL archiving and streaming replication (default), and 'logical' for enhanced logging to enable logical decoding; while 'minimal' generates the least WAL volume, 'replica' or higher is required for WAL archiving and recovery, and using 'logical' can significantly increase WAL volume, especially with numerous updates on REPLICA IDENTITY FULL tables.
