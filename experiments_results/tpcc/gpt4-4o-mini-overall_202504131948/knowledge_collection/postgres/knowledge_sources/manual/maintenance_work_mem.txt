The 'maintenance_work_mem' knob specifies the maximum memory (default is 64MB) for maintenance operations like VACUUM and CREATE INDEX, with the capacity to allocate up to 1GB for VACUUM and potentially larger values to enhance performance, particularly when autovacuum may multiply this allocation by the number of autovacuum workers running.
