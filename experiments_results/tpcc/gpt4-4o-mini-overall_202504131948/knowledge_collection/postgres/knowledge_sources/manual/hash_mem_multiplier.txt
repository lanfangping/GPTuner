The 'hash_mem_multiplier' parameter determines the maximum memory for hash operations by multiplying it with the 'work_mem', with a default of 1.0; increasing it to 1.5 or 2.0 can help in mixed workloads, while values between 2.0 and 8.0 may be beneficial if 'work_mem' is set to 40MB or more to reduce memory pressure.
