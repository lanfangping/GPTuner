The 'fsync' parameter in PostgreSQL, when enabled, ensures data durability by invoking fsync() calls to physically write updates to disk, which is crucial for data recovery after crashes, but disabling it can improve performance significantly, albeit at the risk of unrecoverable data corruption, particularly in noncritical transactions where alternatives like turning off synchronous_commit might be sufficient.
