The 'wal_compression' knob, which is off by default and can only be modified by superusers, enables PostgreSQL to compress full page images in the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) during base backups or when full_page_writes is active, potentially reducing WAL volume and associated storage costs, albeit with increased CPU usage for the compression and decompression processes.
