The 'statement_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL aborts any statement that runs longer than a specified duration (default is 0 milliseconds, which disables the timeout), and this timeout is individually applied to each SQL statement within a single message starting when the command is received until it completes, with the possibility of logging the timeout if the logging level is set to ERROR or lower.
