The knob 'force_parallel_mode' can be set to three values: 'off' to use parallel queries only when performance improvements are expected, 'on' to enforce parallel query execution for safe queries (which adds a Gather node to the query plan), or 'regress' to enable forced parallelism while suppressing parallel worker context messages and hiding Gather nodes in EXPLAIN output for testing consistency, thus facilitating regression testing under safety considerations.
