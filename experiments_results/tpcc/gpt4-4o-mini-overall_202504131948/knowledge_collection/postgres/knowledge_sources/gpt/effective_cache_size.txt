To set the `effective_cache_size` in PostgreSQL, configure it to approximately 50-75% of your system's total RAM, for example, if your server has 16 GB of RAM, set `effective_cache_size` to between 8 GB and 12 GB to optimize query performance by assisting the query planner in estimating how much disk caching might be available.
