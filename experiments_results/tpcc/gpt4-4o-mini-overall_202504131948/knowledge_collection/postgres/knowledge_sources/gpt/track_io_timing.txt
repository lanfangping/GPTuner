To set the `track_io_timing` knob in PostgreSQL, you should set its value to `on` to enable tracking of I/O timings, which can help diagnose performance issues effectively; if you want to limit the performance overhead, monitor your workload, and adjust as needed based on observed behavior, but typically this feature is effective with a minimal impact on performance.
