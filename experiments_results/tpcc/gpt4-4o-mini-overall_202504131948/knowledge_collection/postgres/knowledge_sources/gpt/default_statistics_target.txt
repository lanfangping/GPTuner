For the `default_statistics_target` knob in PostgreSQL, set its value between 100 and 1000 (with a default of 100) depending on the complexity of your queries and the size of your data, where higher values improve query planner statistics for more accurate execution plans at the cost of increased planning time and storage overhead.
