To set the `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` in PostgreSQL, a typical starting value is 50 for standard databases, but it can be adjusted based on your workload and table size; for larger tables, consider increasing it to 200 or 300 to reduce frequent vacuum operations while ensuring that dead tuple cleanup remains effective.
