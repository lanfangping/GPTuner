To set the `max_wal_senders` parameter in PostgreSQL, configure the value to at least the number of concurrent replication connections you expect to have, typically starting with a minimum of 2 to 5 for a small to medium-sized system, but increase it based on your specific replication needs and workload, ensuring it does not exceed a maximum of 10 for most scenarios.
