To configure the `wal_sync_method` in PostgreSQL, set it to `fsync` for standard durability or `fdatasync` for a balance of performance and durability, but if you have specific needs for maximum performance with durability, consider advanced methods like `open_sync` or `libaio`, depending on your system's I/O capabilities; consult PostgreSQL's documentation for recommendations based on your particular workload and environment.
