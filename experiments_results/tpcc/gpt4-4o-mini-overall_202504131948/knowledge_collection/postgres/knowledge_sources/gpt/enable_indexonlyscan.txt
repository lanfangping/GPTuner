To enable the `enable_indexonlyscan` feature in PostgreSQL, set its value to `on` by executing the SQL command `SET enable_indexonlyscan = true;` or by modifying the `postgresql.conf` configuration file with the line `enable_indexonlyscan = on` and then reloading the configuration for it to take effect.
