To set the `wal_buffers` value in PostgreSQL, a good starting point is to set it to 16MB (default is typically 16KB) for systems with heavy write workloads, while considering that you can increase it further to around 1% of RAM for optimal performance, but usually not exceeding 16MB unless you have specific needs.
