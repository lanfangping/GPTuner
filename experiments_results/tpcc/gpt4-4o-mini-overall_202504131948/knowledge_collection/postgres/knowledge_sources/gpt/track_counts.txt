To set the 'track_counts' knob in PostgreSQL, you should enable it by setting the value to 'on' for better statistics tracking, which is especially beneficial when working with a workload that involves frequent updates and queries; this typically works well when the database contains more than 100,000 rows or if you have queries that heavily rely on accurate statistics, as it allows the query planner to make more informed decisions.
