To set the `max_connections` value in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to begin with a base value of 100 connections and increase it in increments of 10-20 connections, keeping in mind the server's available RAMâ€”typically allowing for about 10 MB of RAM per connection; for example, on a server with 8 GB of RAM, you might set `max_connections` to around 400 to 500, but always monitor performance and adjust as necessary.
