To optimize the 'autovacuum' setting in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to set the `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` to a value between 2000 and 4000 for moderate workloads, while adjusting `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` to 20 milliseconds or more to balance system resources during high transaction periods.
