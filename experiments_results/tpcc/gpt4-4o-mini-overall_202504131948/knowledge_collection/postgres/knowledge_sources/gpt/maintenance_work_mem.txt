To set the `maintenance_work_mem` value in PostgreSQL, allocate about 10-20% of your system's RAM for maintenance operations, with a recommended maximum around 1GB; for example, if you have 16GB of RAM, setting `maintenance_work_mem` to 1.6GB (or 1600MB) would be appropriate, but you can cap it at 1GB to avoid excessive memory usage during maintenance tasks like VACUUM and CREATE INDEX.
