To set the `track_activities` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust its value to `on` to enable tracking of active SQL commands for each session, which is beneficial for monitoring and performance analysis, typically leaving it enabled (set to `on`) for most production environments, while it can be set to `off` when minimal overhead is desired.
