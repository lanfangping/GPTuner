To set the `vacuum_cost_delay` parameter in PostgreSQL, you should typically start with a value between 20 to 200 milliseconds, depending on your workload, where a lower value increases vacuum activity but can impact performance; testing with values like 40 ms can help balance vacuuming efficiency and system responsiveness.
