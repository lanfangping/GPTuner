To set the `hash_mem_multiplier` in PostgreSQL, adjust its value based on your system's RAM; a common recommendation is to start with a multiplier of 2 for systems with less than 4 GB of RAM, and increase it incrementally to 4 or more for systems with larger memory capacities, ensuring that the overall memory limit does not exceed 25% of available memory to avoid system performance degradation.
