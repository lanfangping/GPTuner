{'suggestion': "Configure the `max_wal_size` parameter in PostgreSQL to a value between 2 MB and 4096 MB, based on your system's workload and available disk space, while ensuring it does not exceed 25% of your total disk space dedicated to PostgreSQL. The default is 1 GB, but increasing this value can lead to longer crash recovery times, and unless there are disk space constraints, it is advisable to raise the value to ensure that automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout rather than disk space."}
