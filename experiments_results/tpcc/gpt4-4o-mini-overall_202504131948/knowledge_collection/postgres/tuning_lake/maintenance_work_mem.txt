{'suggestion': "To optimize PostgreSQL maintenance operations, set the `maintenance_work_mem` value to allocate a significant portion of your system's RAM, ideally about 10-20% of total RAM, to enhance the performance of tasks like VACUUM and CREATE INDEX. For instance, on a system with 16GB of RAM, a setting of 1024 kB is appropriate, but ensure that you adjust this value according to your system's capacity and workload to avoid excessive memory usage. Additionally, be aware that the autovacuum process may increase memory allocation based on the number of autovacuum workers, so consider this when configuring the setting."}
