{'suggestion': "To optimize the `hash_mem_multiplier` in PostgreSQL, set it based on your system's RAM and workload requirements. The default value is 1.0, but for systems with less than 4 GB of RAM, start with a multiplier of 2.0. For systems with larger memory capacities, consider increasing the multiplier incrementally up to 8.0, especially if `work_mem` is set to 40MB or more, ensuring that the total memory used does not exceed 25% of available memory to maintain system performance."}
