{'suggestion': "To optimize query performance in PostgreSQL, ensure that the 'enable_indexonlyscan' feature is set to 'on', which is enabled by default. This allows the query planner to utilize index-only scans, provided that the 'enable_indexscan' setting is also enabled. You can set it by executing the SQL command `SET enable_indexonlyscan = true;` or by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file with the line `enable_indexonlyscan = on`, followed by reloading the configuration."}
