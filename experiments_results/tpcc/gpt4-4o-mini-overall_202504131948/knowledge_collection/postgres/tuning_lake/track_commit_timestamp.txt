{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `track_commit_timestamp` parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to `on` in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line to enable tracking of commit timestamps, which enhances accuracy. Ensure that your system has sufficient memory and disk performance to manage the additional overhead associated with this setting.'}
