{'suggestion': "To optimize I/O operations in PostgreSQL, set the 'effective_io_concurrency' to a value of 200 for SSDs, which can handle higher concurrency, and for spinning disks, adjust based on the number of disks in your RAID setup, typically using values between 1-10. Be mindful of potential CPU overhead with excessively high settings and adjust further based on your system's performance and workload characteristics."}
