{'suggestion': "To optimize the 'checkpoint_completion_target' in PostgreSQL, configure it in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line to a value between 0.5 and 0.9, with a typical recommendation around 0.7. This setting helps to smooth I/O activity of checkpoints over larger periods, reducing the I/O impact on the system."}
