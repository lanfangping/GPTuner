{'suggestion': "The 'jit' (Just-In-Time compilation) parameter in PostgreSQL controls its performance optimization and is enabled by default, which is beneficial for executing queries that involve complex computations. It is generally recommended to keep it enabled unless you are running an OLTP system with simple queries or encounter specific performance issues."}
