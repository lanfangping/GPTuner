{'suggestion': "Configure the 'shared_buffers' parameter in PostgreSQL to 25% of the system's total RAM for dedicated database servers, with a recommended starting value of at least 16MB for smaller instances and potentially higher for larger systems. For systems with 1GB or more, avoid exceeding 40% of RAM for optimal performance. Additionally, consider conducting benchmarks to fine-tune this setting and be mindful of its relationship with OS kernel parameters 'shmmax' and 'shmall'. Adjust accordingly for non-dedicated servers, as each PostgreSQL instance will reserve its own memory allocations."}
