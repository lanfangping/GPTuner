{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `vacuum_cost_delay` parameter in PostgreSQL, start with a recommended setting typically under 1 millisecond for optimal performance. This parameter specifies the sleep duration in milliseconds when the vacuuming cost limit is exceeded, and while the default value is 0 (disabled), testing values around 40 ms can help balance vacuuming efficiency and system responsiveness, especially on busy systems where reducing the value may increase background writer activity. Adjustments should be made in multiples of 10 ms to fine-tune performance.'}
