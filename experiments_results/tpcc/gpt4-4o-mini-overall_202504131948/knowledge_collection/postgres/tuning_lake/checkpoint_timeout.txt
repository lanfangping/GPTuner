{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `checkpoint_timeout` setting in PostgreSQL, start by configuring it to a value around 900 seconds (15 minutes) to balance checkpoint frequency and performance. While this can improve I/O usage by reducing the frequency of checkpoints, be aware that longer intervals may increase recovery time after a crash. Additionally, consider tuning the `checkpoint_completion_target` and background writer activity to manage potential I/O spikes.'}
