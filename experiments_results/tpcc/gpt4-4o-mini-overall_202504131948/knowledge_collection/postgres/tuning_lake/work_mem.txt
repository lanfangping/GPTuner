{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL, begin with a value of 16MB, which is generally considered a good starting point for most scenarios. This parameter sets the maximum memory limit for query operations, such as sorting and hash tables, and should be adjusted based on the complexity of your queries and the number of concurrent sessions. For OLTP queries with simple operations, a lower value in the low MBs may suffice, while for OLAP queries, particularly with fewer concurrent operations, it can be increased into the GB range. Be mindful that if the memory allocated is insufficient, PostgreSQL will resort to using disk, which can negatively impact performance. Conversely, setting it too high may destabilize node throughput under heavy concurrency. To estimate the total potential memory consumed, consider the formula: max_connections * N, where N is a small single-digit number. Adjust the `work_mem` value according to your memory resources and query patterns.'}
