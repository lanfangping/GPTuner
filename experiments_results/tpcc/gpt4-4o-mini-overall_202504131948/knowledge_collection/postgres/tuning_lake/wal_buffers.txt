{'suggestion': 'To optimize write performance in PostgreSQL, set the `wal_buffers` value to a few megabytes, ideally around 2048 (16MB) for systems with heavy write workloads. This value can be manually adjusted, but be aware that settings below 32kB will default to 32kB. The default allocation is approximately 3% of shared_buffers, so consider increasing it further up to around 1% of RAM for optimal performance.'}
