{'suggestion': 'To enhance query performance for large datasets in PostgreSQL, set the knob `enable_partitionwise_aggregate` to `on`. This setting, which is off by default, allows the query planner to perform grouping or aggregation separately for each partition of a table, potentially increasing memory usage and query planning costs linearly with the number of partitions scanned.'}
