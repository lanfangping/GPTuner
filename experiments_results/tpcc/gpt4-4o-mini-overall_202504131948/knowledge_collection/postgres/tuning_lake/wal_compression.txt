{'suggestion': 'To optimize PostgreSQL performance, enable the `wal_compression` parameter by setting it to `on`. This feature, which is off by default and requires superuser privileges to modify, allows PostgreSQL to compress full page images in the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) during base backups or when `full_page_writes` is active. This can significantly reduce WAL volume and associated storage costs, especially in systems with high write loads. However, be aware that enabling this feature may increase CPU usage due to the overhead of compression and decompression processes, so ensure your system has adequate CPU resources.'}
