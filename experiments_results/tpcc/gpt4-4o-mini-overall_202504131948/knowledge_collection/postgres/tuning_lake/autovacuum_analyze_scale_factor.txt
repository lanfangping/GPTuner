{'suggestion': "Set the `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` in PostgreSQL to a default value of 0.1 (10% of the number of live tuples) to trigger an automatic ANALYZE when 10% of the table's rows have been modified. For tables with high update rates, consider adjusting this value lower, such as to 0.05 (5%), to ensure more frequent analysis. This setting can be configured in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line, and it can also be overridden for specific tables using their storage parameters."}
