{'suggestion': 'To optimize the vacuuming process in PostgreSQL, adjust the `vacuum_cost_limit` setting, which controls the accumulated cost threshold that triggers the vacuuming process to pause. A common starting point for this value is 2000 for moderate workloads, and it can be increased to 10000 for higher-throughput systems that require more aggressive vacuuming to minimize bloat.'}
