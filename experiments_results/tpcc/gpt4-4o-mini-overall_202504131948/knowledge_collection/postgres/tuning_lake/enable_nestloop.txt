{'suggestion': 'To optimize the `enable_nestloop` parameter in PostgreSQL, keep its default setting to `on` (true), as it controls the use of nested-loop join plans in the query planner. This setting is beneficial for queries involving smaller tables or selective joins. However, consider setting it to `off` (false) when dealing with larger datasets to discourage the use of nested-loop joins in favor of alternative methods.'}
