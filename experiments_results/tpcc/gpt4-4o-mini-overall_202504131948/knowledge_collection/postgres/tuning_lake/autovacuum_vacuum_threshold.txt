{'suggestion': 'To configure the `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` in PostgreSQL, set it in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line, with the option to override it on a per-table basis. A typical starting value is 50 for standard databases, but for larger tables, consider increasing it to 200 to reduce the frequency of vacuum operations while ensuring effective cleanup of dead tuples.'}
