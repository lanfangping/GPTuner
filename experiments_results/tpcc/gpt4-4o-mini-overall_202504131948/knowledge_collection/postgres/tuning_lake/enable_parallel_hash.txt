{'suggestion': "To optimize your PostgreSQL performance when working with large data sets, ensure that the 'enable_parallel_hash' knob is set to 'on'. This setting allows the query planner to utilize parallel hash-join plan types, which can enhance efficiency, although it will have no effect if hash-join plans are not activated."}
