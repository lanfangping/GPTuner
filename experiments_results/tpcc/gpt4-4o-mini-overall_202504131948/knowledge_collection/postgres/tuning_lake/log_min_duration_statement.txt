{'suggestion': 'To effectively monitor SQL query performance in PostgreSQL, set the `log_min_duration_statement` to a reasonable threshold, such as `1000` milliseconds for general performance monitoring or `250` milliseconds for more detailed analysis in busy applications. Avoid setting it to `0` as this will log all queries, which can overwhelm a busy server. Remember that only superusers can modify this parameter, and consider using additional tools like `pg_stat_statements` or `pg_stat_monitor` for a comprehensive understanding of query performance.'}
