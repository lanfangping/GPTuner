{'suggestion': "To optimize deadlock detection in PostgreSQL, set the 'deadlock_timeout' to a value around 10000 milliseconds, starting from the default of 1000 milliseconds. This configuration allows the system to effectively detect deadlocks while accommodating typical transaction times on heavily loaded servers and influencing the generation of lock wait logs."}
