{'suggestion': "To enable partition-wise joins in PostgreSQL, set the `enable_partitionwise_join` parameter to `on` by adding the line `SET enable_partitionwise_join TO 'on';` in your session or in the `postgresql.conf` file for a system-wide configuration. Be aware that utilizing this feature can lead to increased memory consumption in execution and planning costs, especially as the number of partitions being scanned increases."}
