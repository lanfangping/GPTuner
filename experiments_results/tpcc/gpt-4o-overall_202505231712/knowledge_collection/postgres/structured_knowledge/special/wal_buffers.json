{"think_procedure": "To classify the 'wal_buffers' knob in PostgreSQL, first understand its purpose: it sets the amount of memory allocated for WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) data. Typically, this value is set in kilobytes and has a natural numerical order, where increasing the value allocates more memory for WAL buffers, potentially improving performance. However, in PostgreSQL, if 'wal_buffers' is set to -1, it automatically chooses a default size based on the shared_buffers setting. This special value (-1) changes the behavior of the knob from a regular numerical setting to an automatic configuration, indicating that 'wal_buffers' is a special knob with a special value that alters its behavior.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
