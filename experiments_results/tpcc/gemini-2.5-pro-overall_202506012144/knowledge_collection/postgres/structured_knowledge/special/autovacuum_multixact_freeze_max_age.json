{"think_procedure": "1. Understand the definition of a 'special knob': A numerical knob with specific values (e.g., -1, 0) that, when set, trigger a behavior fundamentally different from its normal graded operation (e.g., disabling a feature). These special values must be valid settings for the knob.\n2. Research the specified PostgreSQL knob: `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age`.\n3. Consult official PostgreSQL documentation for its characteristics:\n    a. Function: Specifies the maximum age (in multixactions) that a table's `pg_class.relminmxid` can attain before an `AUTOVACUUM` operation is forced to prevent multixact ID wraparound failure.\n    b. Data type: integer.\n    c. Default value: 400,000,000.\n    d. Minimum value: 10,000,000 (as per `min_val` in source code comments/configuration system).\n    e. Maximum value: 2,000,000,000 (as per `max_val`).\n4. Evaluate against the 'special knob' definition:\n    a. Are values like -1 or 0 valid settings for this knob? No, they are below the documented minimum valid value of 10,000,000. Therefore, they cannot be set to trigger a special behavior.\n    b. Does the knob have any other documented numerical value within its valid range that triggers a 'very different function' (e.g., disabling the feature)? No. Within its valid range [10,000,000, 2,000,000,000], the knob consistently defines a threshold for multixact freezing. The behavior is quantitative (more or less aggressive freezing) rather than a qualitative change in function.\n    c. The documentation emphasizes that the system will launch autovacuum processes to prevent wraparound even if `autovacuum` itself is disabled, indicating the critical nature of this mechanism and that it's not designed to be switched off by a special value of this knob.\n5. Conclusion: `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age` does not fit the definition of a 'special knob' because it does not have designated special values like -1 or 0 that are settable and change its core function to something like 'disabled'.\n6. Based on this conclusion, set `special_knob` to `false`.\n7. Since it is not a special knob, there is no 'special value' in the sense defined. Set `special_value` to `null`.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
