{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: `autovacuum_work_mem`.\n2. Consult the official PostgreSQL documentation for this knob to understand its purpose, allowed values, default value, and behavior associated with specific values.\n3. The documentation states that `autovacuum_work_mem` specifies the maximum memory to be used by each autovacuum worker process. The default value is -1.\n4. If `autovacuum_work_mem` is set to -1, it signifies that the value of `maintenance_work_mem` should be used instead.\n5. If `autovacuum_work_mem` is set to a positive integer (optionally with units, defaulting to kilobytes if no units are specified), it directly specifies the memory amount. This establishes a \"regular operation\" where the knob's value directly corresponds to a memory size, and there's a natural order (larger value = more memory).\n6. Compare the behavior of the value -1 to this regular operation. The value -1 does not directly specify a memory amount. Instead, it triggers a different mechanism for determining the memory (i.e., using the value of `maintenance_work_mem`). This constitutes a \"very different function\" compared to its regular operation of direct memory specification, fitting the definition of a special knob.\n7. Assess if -1 breaks the natural order. The natural order for positive values is that an increase in the knob's value leads to an increase in allocated memory. The value -1 is numerically smaller than any positive memory specification. However, the actual memory allocated when `autovacuum_work_mem` is -1 depends on `maintenance_work_mem`, which could be larger than a memory amount specified by a positive `autovacuum_work_mem` value. For example, if `maintenance_work_mem` is 1GB, setting `autovacuum_work_mem = -1` results in 1GB of memory for autovacuum workers. If one were to set `autovacuum_work_mem = 512MB` (a numerically larger input than -1 if units are considered consistently), the memory used would be 512MB. In this scenario, the input -1 (numerically small) leads to a larger memory allocation (1GB) than the input 512MB. This breaks a simple monotonic relationship between the knob's set value and its direct effect if -1 were treated as part of the ordinary numerical scale of memory sizes.\n8. Based on this analysis, conclude that `autovacuum_work_mem` is a special knob because the value -1 makes it perform a different function (delegation of value determination) compared to its regular operation (direct specification of value) and breaks the natural numerical order of memory sizing.\n9. Identify the special value as -1. No other values like 0 are documented as having such distinct special behavior for this particular knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
