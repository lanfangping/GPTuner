{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: `enable_material`.\n2. Consult the PostgreSQL documentation to determine the knob's type and valid values. `enable_material` is a boolean knob. Its valid values are `on` (true) and `off` (false).\n3. Analyze the provided definition of a 'special knob':\n    a. The definition states, 'Numerical knobs typically have a natural order.' This implies the knob must be numerical for this classification.\n    b. It further specifies, 'some \"special\" numerical knobs have special values, such as -1 or 0, that break this natural order.' This highlights that the special values are numerical and distinct from a typical range.\n    c. The definition also notes, 'When set to a special value, such knob performs a very different function compared to its regular operation... Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob.' This means the knob primarily operates on a numerical scale but has specific numerical values that trigger distinct behaviors.\n4. Evaluate `enable_material` against this definition:\n    a. `enable_material` is a boolean knob, not a numerical knob. This is the primary disqualifier.\n    b. Consequently, it does not take numerical values like -1 or 0. Its values (`on`/`off`) are intrinsic to its boolean nature, directly controlling a feature's state (enabled/disabled). This is the standard behavior for a boolean toggle, not a special numerical value breaking a numerical order.\n    c. Since it is not a numerical knob, it cannot 'otherwise behave like a regular numerical knob.'\n5. Conclude whether `enable_material` fits the definition of a 'special knob': Based on the definition focusing on numerical knobs with special numerical values, `enable_material` does not qualify as a 'special knob'.\n6. Determine the output values: `special_knob` is `false`. Since it is not a special knob, `special_value` is `null`.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
