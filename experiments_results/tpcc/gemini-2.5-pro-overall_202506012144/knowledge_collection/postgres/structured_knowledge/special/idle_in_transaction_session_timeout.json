{"think_procedure": "1. Understand the knob's purpose: `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` is used to terminate sessions that are idle within an open transaction for a specified duration. 2. Consult PostgreSQL documentation: Check the official PostgreSQL documentation for `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` to understand its allowed values, default value, and any special meanings associated with specific values. 3. Identify special values: The documentation states: 'The default value is 0, which disables the timeout.' 4. Analyze behavior: A value of 0 means the feature is disabled. Any positive value (e.g., 1000 milliseconds) enables the feature and sets a specific timeout duration. The behavior at 0 (disabled) is distinctly different from its behavior at positive values (enabled with a specific duration). This change in function (disabling vs. setting a duration) signifies a special value. 5. Determine if it's a special knob: Since 0 has a special meaning (disabling the feature) that breaks the natural order of 'timeout duration', it qualifies as a special knob. 6. Identify the special value: The special value is 0.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
