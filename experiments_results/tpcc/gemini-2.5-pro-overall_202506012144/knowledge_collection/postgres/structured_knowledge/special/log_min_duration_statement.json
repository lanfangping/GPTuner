{"think_procedure": "1. Understand the knob: The knob is `log_min_duration_statement` from PostgreSQL.\n2. Research its behavior: Consult PostgreSQL documentation or knowledge about this knob.\n   - `log_min_duration_statement` specifies the minimum execution time (in milliseconds) a statement must run for its duration to be logged.\n   - If set to `-1` (default), it disables logging of statement durations.\n   - If set to `0`, it logs the duration of all statements.\n   - If set to a positive value `X`, it logs statements whose duration is `X` milliseconds or more.\n3. Analyze for 'special' behavior: A special knob has values that break the natural numerical order or enable/disable features.\n   - Regular operation: Positive values (e.g., 100, 200, 1000) follow a natural order \u2013 increasing the value means logging fewer, longer-running statements. This is the typical numerical behavior.\n   - Special value `-1`: This value disables the feature of logging statement durations. This is a distinct behavior, not part of the continuous scale of thresholding. It fundamentally changes the knob's function to 'off'.\n   - Special value `0`: This value means 'log all statements'. While `0` is a number, its effect is to remove the thresholding aspect entirely, making it a distinct mode of operation compared to positive values. It's not just a lower threshold but a different logging rule.\n4. Classify the knob: Since `-1` disables the feature and `0` enables a distinct 'log all' mode, both of which are different from the regular thresholding behavior of positive values, `log_min_duration_statement` is a special knob.\n5. Identify a special value: Both `-1` and `0` are special. The value `-1` is a common pattern for disabling features, making it a clear example of a special value. The prompt asks for 'a' special value.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
