{"think_procedure": "1. Understand the definition of a 'special knob': A numerical knob with special values (like -1 or 0) that alter its function significantly, breaking the natural numerical order, often by disabling a feature or enabling a completely different mode of operation.\n2. Research the specific PostgreSQL knob: 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers'.\n3. Consult the official PostgreSQL documentation for 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers'.\n4. The documentation states: 'Sets the maximum number of parallel worker processes that can be started by a single utility command. [...] The default value is 2. Setting this value to 0 disables parallel index builds.'\n5. Identify if any value causes a distinct change in behavior. The value '0' explicitly 'disables parallel index builds'.\n6. Regular positive values (1, 2, 3, ...) determine the number of workers to use, which is a quantitative change.\n7. The value '0' is not just a lower bound in the quantitative scale but a qualitative change \u2013 it turns off the feature.\n8. This behavior aligns with the definition of a special knob having a special value that changes its function.\n9. Therefore, 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers' is a special knob.\n10. The special value is '0'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
