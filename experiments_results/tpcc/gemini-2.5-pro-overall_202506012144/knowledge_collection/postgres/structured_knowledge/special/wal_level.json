{"think_procedure": ["1. Understand the definition of a 'special knob': It must be a numerical knob that has specific values (e.g., -1, 0) which cause it to perform a very different function, breaking its natural numerical order. Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob.", "2. Examine the PostgreSQL knob: `wal_level`.", "3. Determine the data type and possible values of `wal_level`. According to PostgreSQL documentation, `wal_level` is an enumerated type.", "4. The possible values for `wal_level` are string literals: 'minimal', 'replica', and 'logical'.", "5. Since `wal_level` accepts string literals and not numerical values, it is not a numerical knob.", "6. The definition of a 'special knob' explicitly states it applies to 'numerical knobs'.", "7. As `wal_level` is not a numerical knob, it cannot be classified as a 'special knob' according to the provided definition.", "8. Therefore, the 'special_knob' attribute will be false, and 'special_value' will be null as it's not applicable."], "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
