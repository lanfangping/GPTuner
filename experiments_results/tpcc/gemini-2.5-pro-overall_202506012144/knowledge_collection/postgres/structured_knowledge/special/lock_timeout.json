{"think_procedure": "1. Researched the PostgreSQL knob 'lock_timeout'. \n2. Found its description in the PostgreSQL documentation. \n3. The documentation states: 'Abort any statement that waits longer than the specified number of milliseconds... A value of zero (the default) turns this off.' \n4. Regular positive values (e.g., 1000ms) set a specific maximum wait time. This is a quantitative adjustment of the timeout duration. \n5. The value 0, however, disables the timeout feature entirely. This means statements will wait indefinitely for a lock, which is a qualitative change in behavior compared to setting a finite wait time. \n6. This 'off' state (value 0) is a special function distinct from its behavior with other positive numerical values. \n7. Therefore, 'lock_timeout' is classified as a special knob with the special value 0.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
