{"think_procedure": "1. Understand the definition of a 'special numerical knob': It must be a numerical knob with a natural order, but certain specific numerical values (e.g., -1, 0) trigger a distinct behavior, breaking the natural order. 2. Research the PostgreSQL knob 'huge_pages'. According to the PostgreSQL documentation, 'huge_pages' controls whether huge pages are requested for the main shared memory area. 3. Identify the possible values for 'huge_pages'. The allowed values are 'try', 'on', and 'off'. 4. Determine if 'huge_pages' is a numerical knob. The values 'try', 'on', 'off' are string literals representing enumerated states, not numerical values. Therefore, 'huge_pages' is an enumerated type knob, not a numerical knob. 5. Since 'huge_pages' is not a numerical knob, it cannot fit the provided definition of a 'special numerical knob'. The criteria of having special numerical values like -1 or 0 that break a natural numerical order do not apply. 6. Conclude that 'huge_pages' is not a 'special numerical knob' based on the given definition.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
