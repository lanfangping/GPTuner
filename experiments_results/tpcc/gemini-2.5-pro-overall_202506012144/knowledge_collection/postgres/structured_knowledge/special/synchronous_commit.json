{"think_procedure": "1. The definition of a 'special knob' is a *numerical knob* with special values (e.g., -1, 0) that alter its behavior significantly, such as disabling a feature, and break its natural numerical order. \n2. The knob `synchronous_commit` is examined. \n3. PostgreSQL's `pg_settings` view (or documentation) indicates `synchronous_commit` has a `vartype` of `enum`. Its accepted values are string literals (`on`, `off`, `local`, `remote_write`, `remote_apply`), not general numerical inputs. \n4. Therefore, `synchronous_commit` is not a 'numerical knob'. \n5. According to the provided definition, since `synchronous_commit` is not a numerical knob, it cannot be classified as a 'special knob'. \n6. Thus, `special_knob` is `false`, and `special_value` is `null`.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
