{"think_procedure": ["1. Analyze the knob `transaction_isolation` and its possible values.", "   - The `transaction_isolation` knob in PostgreSQL determines the isolation level for transactions.", "   - Its valid values are string literals: 'read uncommitted', 'read committed', 'repeatable read', and 'serializable'.", "2. Determine if `transaction_isolation` is a 'numerical knob' as per the definition's context.", "   - A 'numerical knob' typically implies values that are numbers (integers, floats) and have a natural arithmetic order (e.g., sizes, counts, durations).", "   - The values of `transaction_isolation` are categorical strings (enum type), not direct numerical representations like 0, 1, -1, 1024.", "   - While these levels have an order of strictness, the knob itself is not set using numerical inputs that represent a scale which could be broken by a special number like -1 or 0.", "   - Therefore, `transaction_isolation` is not considered a 'numerical knob' in the primary sense.", "3. Apply the definition of a 'special knob'.", "   - The definition states: \"Numerical knobs typically have a natural order. However, some 'special' numerical knobs have special values, such as -1 or 0, that break this natural order. When set to a special value, such knob performs a very different function compared to its regular operation... Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob.\"", "   - Since `transaction_isolation` is not a numerical knob, it does not fit the premise for being a 'special numerical knob'.", "4. Check for 'special values' in the context of the definition.", "   - The definition gives examples of special values like -1 or 0 for numerical knobs, which cause a deviation from their regular numerical behavior (e.g., -1 for autotune, 0 for disable).", "   - `transaction_isolation` does not have such numerical special values. Each of its string values defines a specific, standard isolation level. None of them serve as a meta-value like 'disable' or 'auto' in the way -1 or 0 might for a genuinely numerical parameter (e.g., `wal_buffers = -1` for auto-configuration in PostgreSQL is a special numerical knob).", "5. Conclude on whether `transaction_isolation` is a 'special knob'.", "   - Based on the definition focusing on 'numerical knobs' and specific types of 'special values' (-1, 0), `transaction_isolation` does not qualify.", "   - Therefore, `special_knob` is false.", "6.
