{"think_procedure": "1. Understand the definition of a 'special knob': A numerical knob with specific values (e.g., -1, 0) that trigger a distinctly different behavior or disable a feature, breaking the natural numerical order. 2. Research the PostgreSQL knob 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age'. Key aspects to check are its purpose, data type, valid range, and any documented special behaviors for specific values. 3. According to PostgreSQL documentation, 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' specifies the maximum transaction age before an aggressive VACUUM is forced to prevent transaction ID wraparound. Its type is integer. 4. The valid range for 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' is from 100,000 to 2,000,000,000. 5. There are no documented special values like -1 or 0 for this knob that would disable the feature or fundamentally change its behavior. The knob always defines a threshold. Lower values mean more frequent aggressive vacuums, higher values mean less frequent. This is a continuous behavior within its valid range. 6. The feature it controls (setting a threshold for wraparound prevention) is always active; there's no value for this knob that disables this specific thresholding mechanism. Even if general autovacuum is off, the system uses this threshold for emergency anti-wraparound vacuums. 7. Conclude that 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' does not fit the definition of a 'special knob' as it lacks special values that alter its core function or disable it. 8. Set 'special_knob' to false. 9. Since it's not a special knob, 'special_value' should be null.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
