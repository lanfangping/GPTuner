{"think_procedure": "1. Understand the definition of a 'special knob': It applies to numerical knobs that have a natural order. These knobs have 'special' numerical values (e.g., -1, 0) that break this natural order and cause the knob to perform a very different function (e.g., disabling a feature). Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob.\n2. Identify the knob in question: 'enable_tidscan'.\n3. Determine the type of 'enable_tidscan'. According to PostgreSQL documentation, 'enable_tidscan' is a boolean knob.\n4. Compare the knob's characteristics with the definition of a 'special knob':\n    a. Is 'enable_tidscan' a numerical knob? No, it is a boolean knob. The definition of a 'special knob' explicitly refers to 'numerical knobs'.\n    b. Does it have a natural numerical order that can be broken by special numerical values like -1 or 0? No, as a boolean knob, its values are 'true'/'on' or 'false'/'off', which are not numerical values in the sense described (like integers or floats with a range).\n    c. While setting 'enable_tidscan' to 'false' disables TID scan plans, this is one of its two fundamental operational states, not a 'special' value deviating from a 'regular numerical operation' as described for numerical knobs.\n5. Conclude that 'enable_tidscan' is not a 'special knob' according to the provided definition primarily because it is not a numerical knob.\n6. Set 'special_knob' to false.\n7. Since it is not a special knob, 'special_value' is not applicable and should be set to null.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
