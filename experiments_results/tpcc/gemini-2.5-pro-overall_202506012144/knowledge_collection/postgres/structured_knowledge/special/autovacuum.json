{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the target knob: `autovacuum`.\n2. Check PostgreSQL documentation for `autovacuum`: It is a boolean knob, accepting `on` or `off` (or equivalent boolean representations) to enable or disable the autovacuum daemon.\n3. Analyze the provided definition of a 'special knob':\n    a. It is a 'numerical knob'.\n    b. It has 'special values' (e.g., -1, 0) that alter its function significantly (e.g., disable a feature) and break the 'natural order' of its other numerical values.\n    c. 'Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob,' implying it has a range of non-special numerical values where it operates in a graded or quantitative manner.\n4. Evaluate `autovacuum` against this definition:\n    a. Is `autovacuum` a numerical knob? No, it is boolean. It does not accept a range of numerical inputs for graded control.\n    b. Does it have special numerical values like -1 or 0? While `off` could be conceptually mapped to 0 and disables the feature, the knob itself isn't primarily numerical and doesn't take -1 or 0 as distinct numerical inputs from a broader range.\n    c. Does `off` disable a feature? Yes, it disables the autovacuum process.\n    d. Does it 'otherwise behave like a regular numerical knob'? No. Beyond its `on`/`off` states, there are no other numerical values for graded control. It's a simple toggle, not a numerical parameter with specific exceptional values alongside a regular numerical range. The criterion 'Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob' is not met.\n5. Conclude: `autovacuum` does not fit the definition of a 'special knob' because it is not a numerical knob with the described characteristics. Specifically, it lacks the aspect of having a regular numerical operating range in addition to any special values.\n6. Set `special_knob` to `false`.\n7. As it's not a special knob according to the definition, `special_value` is not applicable and should be `null`.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
