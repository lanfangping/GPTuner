{"think_procedure": "1. Understand the knob: `log_autovacuum_min_duration` controls the logging of autovacuum actions based on their duration. 2. Consult PostgreSQL documentation for `log_autovacuum_min_duration`. The documentation states: - If set to -1 (the default), autovacuum actions are not logged. - If set to 0, all autovacuum actions are logged. - If set to a positive value (milliseconds), autovacuum actions are logged if they run for at least that amount of time. 3. Analyze behavior for 'special' characteristics: - Positive values exhibit a natural numerical order: increasing the value sets a higher threshold for logging. This is the 'regular' operation. - A value of -1 disables logging entirely. This is a distinct function (disabling a feature) and breaks the natural order of threshold-based logging. - A value of 0 logs all autovacuum actions, regardless of duration. This is also a distinct function (log everything) and different from the threshold-based behavior of positive values. 4. Identify special values: Both -1 and 0 cause the knob to perform a very different function compared to its regular operation with positive values. 5. Determine if it's a 'special knob': Yes, because it has special values (-1 and 0) that change its core behavior from a simple threshold to either disabling logging or logging everything. 6. Choose a representative special value for the output: The problem asks for a single `special_value`. Both -1 and 0 are special. The value -1, which disables the feature, is a classic example of a special value as described in the problem statement ('disabling a feature'). Therefore, -1 is selected.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
