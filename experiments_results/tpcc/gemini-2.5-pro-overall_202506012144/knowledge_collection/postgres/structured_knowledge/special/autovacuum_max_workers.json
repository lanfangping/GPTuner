{"think_procedure": ["1. Understand the definition of a 'special knob': A numerical knob with specific values (e.g., -1, 0) that cause it to perform a very different function compared to its regular operation, breaking the natural numerical order (e.g., disabling a feature or using a different source for its value).", "2. Research the PostgreSQL knob `autovacuum_max_workers` by consulting the official PostgreSQL documentation.", "3. Identify the knob's purpose: It specifies the maximum number of autovacuum worker processes.", "4. Identify the knob's data type and allowed range: It is an integer, with a minimum value of 1. The default is 3.", "5. Analyze if there are any 'special values' like -1 or 0 that change its behavior drastically:", "   a. Value 0: According to documentation, the minimum value is 1. So, 0 is not a valid setting that would trigger a special behavior; it's simply out of the accepted range for normal operation.", "   b. Value -1: There is no documented special behavior for -1 for `autovacuum_max_workers`. It does not, for example, disable the autovacuum workers or inherit a value from another setting.", "   c. Other values: The knob's value directly corresponds to the number of workers (e.g., 1 means 1 worker, 5 means 5 workers). This indicates a natural numerical order.", "6. Consider how autovacuum is disabled: Autovacuum is disabled by setting the `autovacuum` knob (a boolean knob) to `off`. `autovacuum_max_workers` does not have a special value to disable the feature it relates to; it only configures a parameter of that feature when it's active.", "7. Compare with examples of special knobs: For instance, `log_min_duration_statement` has -1 to disable logging and 0 to log all statements, which are distinct behaviors from its positive values representing a time threshold. `maintenance_work_mem` can be set to -1 to use the `work_mem` setting. `autovacuum_max_workers` does not exhibit such distinct behavior for any specific value.", "8. Conclude: `autovacuum_max_workers` behaves as a regular numerical knob where its value directly quantifies a resource (number of workers) within its valid range. It does not have documented special values that fundamentally alter its function or disable the feature it controls.", "9. Therefore, `autovacuum_max_workers` is not a 'special knob'.", "10. Set `special_knob` to `false` and `special_value` to `null` (or omit, but the prompt asks to fill it if it is special, implying null if not)."], "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
