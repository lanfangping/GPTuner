{"think_procedure": ["1. Understand the definition of a 'special knob': A 'special knob' is a *numerical* knob that has specific values (e.g., -1, 0) which trigger a distinct behavior, different from its usual graded numerical effect, and break the natural numerical order.", "2. Identify the knob in question: `enable_bitmapscan`.", "3. Determine the type of the knob: Consult PostgreSQL documentation. `enable_bitmapscan` is a `boolean` type knob. It controls whether the planner uses bitmap-scan plan types. Its values are `on` (true) or `off` (false).", "4. Check if the knob is numerical: `enable_bitmapscan` is boolean, not numerical.", "5. Apply the 'special knob' definition:", "   - The definition explicitly states 'special *numerical* knobs'.", "   - Since `enable_bitmapscan` is not numerical, it cannot be a 'special numerical knob' according to the provided definition.", "6. Conclusion: `enable_bitmapscan` is not a 'special knob' under the given definition because it is not a numerical knob.", "7. Determine `special_knob` value: `false`.", "8. Determine `special_value`: Since it's not a special knob, there is no special value in the context of the definition. Set to `null`."], "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
