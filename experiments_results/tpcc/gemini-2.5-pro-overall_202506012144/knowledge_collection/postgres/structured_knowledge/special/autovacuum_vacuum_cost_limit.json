{"think_procedure": "1. Understand the definition of a 'special knob': a numerical knob with special values (e.g., -1, 0) that break the natural numerical order and cause the knob to perform a significantly different function (e.g., disabling a feature, or adopting a distinct mode of operation).\n2. Research the specific PostgreSQL knob: 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit'.\n3. Consult the official PostgreSQL documentation for 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' to understand its purpose, allowed values, default value, and the meaning of any specific or out-of-ordinary-range values.\n4. Identify the range of 'regular' numerical values and their behavior. For 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit', positive integers (typically 1 to 10000, though the exact upper bound can vary or be practically unlimited) directly set the cost limit for autovacuum operations.\n5. Check for values like -1, 0, or others that are documented to have a distinct behavior. The PostgreSQL documentation states that for 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit', if -1 is specified (which is the default), the value of the regular 'vacuum_cost_limit' configuration parameter will be used.\n6. Analyze if this distinct behavior for -1 fits the criteria of a 'special value':\n    a. Does it break the natural order? Yes, -1 is outside the typical positive range for cost limits and its interpretation is not simply 'a very low cost limit'.\n    b. Does it perform a 'very different function'? Yes. Instead of directly specifying the cost limit value itself, setting it to -1 causes it to inherit or defer to the value of another knob ('vacuum_cost_limit'). This is a different mode of operation compared to directly setting a numerical limit.\n7. Conclude whether the knob is a 'special knob' based on this analysis. The value -1 makes 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' behave as an alias or a pointer to 'vacuum_cost_limit' for its effective value, which is functionally different from directly setting a cost limit. Therefore, it qualifies as a special knob.\n8. Identify the special value(s). In this case, -1 is the special value.\n9. Format the result as a JSON object with 'think_procedure', 'special_knob' (boolean), and 'special_value'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
