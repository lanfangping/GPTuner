{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the PostgreSQL knob in question: `max_parallel_workers`.\n2. Research the knob's definition, permissible values, and behavior, particularly for potential special values like 0 or -1, by consulting the official PostgreSQL documentation.\n3. According to the documentation, `max_parallel_workers` sets the maximum number of workers for parallel queries.\n4. The documentation specifies that the minimum value for this knob is 0.\n5. Crucially, the documentation states: 'Setting this value to 0 disables parallel query execution.'\n6. For any value greater than 0 (e.g., 1, 2, ..., up to a system-defined maximum), the knob enables parallel queries and sets an upper limit on the number of workers.\n7. Compare the behavior at 0 with behaviors at positive values. At 0, the entire feature (parallel query execution) is disabled. At positive values, the feature is enabled, and the knob tunes its capacity.\n8. This change from 'feature disabled' (at 0) to 'feature enabled and capacity N' (at N > 0) represents a significant functional difference, not merely a point on a continuous scale of 'number of workers'.\n9. The value 0 thus breaks the natural ordinal meaning of the knob (which would typically imply '0 workers allowed' but still within an 'enabled' feature context). Instead, it acts as an on/off switch for the feature itself.\n10. Conclude that `max_parallel_workers` is a 'special knob' because the value 0 triggers a distinct operational mode (feature disabled).\n11. Identify the special value as 0.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
