{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob: vacuum_cost_delay.\n2. Consult PostgreSQL documentation for its behavior, default value, and allowed range.\n3. The documentation for `vacuum_cost_delay` states its unit is milliseconds and its default value is 0.\n4. It further specifies: 'The default value is zero, which disables the cost-based vacuum delay feature.'\n5. If `vacuum_cost_delay` is greater than 0 (e.g., 1, 10, 100 ms), the vacuum process will sleep for that duration when the cost limit is exceeded. This is its regular numerical behavior, where a larger value means a longer delay.\n6. If `vacuum_cost_delay` is 0, the entire cost-based vacuum delay feature is disabled. This is a distinct operational mode compared to just having a very short or no delay within an active feature.\n7. The value 0 fundamentally changes the knob's function from 'set delay duration' to 'disable feature'. This breaks the natural order where 0 would simply mean '0ms delay' within an active system.\n8. Therefore, 0 is a special value for `vacuum_cost_delay`, making it a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
