{"think_procedure": "1. Analyze the knob `enable_sort`: Determine its data type and range of values from PostgreSQL documentation. `enable_sort` is a boolean parameter. Its values are `on` (true) and `off` (false).\n2. Understand the definition of a 'special knob' provided: \"Numerical knobs typically have a natural order. However, some 'special' numerical knobs have special values, such as -1 or 0, that break this natural order. When set to a special value, such knob performs a very different function compared to its regular operation, such as disabling a feature. Otherwise, it behaves like a regular numerical knob.\"\n3. Evaluate if `enable_sort` fits the 'numerical knob' criterion: The definition explicitly refers to \"numerical knobs\". `enable_sort` is boolean, not numerical. It does not have a \"natural order\" in the numerical sense, nor does it take values like -1 or 0 that break such an order.\n4. Evaluate if `enable_sort` fits the 'special value' criterion for numerical knobs: While setting `enable_sort` to `false` disables the planner's use of explicit sort steps (a significantly different function), this is a standard behavior for a boolean toggle. The \"special values\" mentioned (-1, 0) are characteristic of numerical knobs that have a range but use specific numbers outside or at the edge of that range for special meanings. Boolean knobs inherently have two distinct states, and one often disables what the other enables. This doesn't align with the concept of breaking a 'natural order' of a numerical range.\n5. Conclusion: Based on the provided definition, which emphasizes \"numerical knobs\" and special numerical values breaking a natural order, `enable_sort` does not qualify as a 'special knob' in this specific context. It is a standard boolean knob. Therefore, `special_knob` is false, and `special_value` is not applicable.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
