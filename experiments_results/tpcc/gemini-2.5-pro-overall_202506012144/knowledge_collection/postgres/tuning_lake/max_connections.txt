{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `max_connections` parameter defines the maximum number of concurrent database connections. Key considerations for setting it are:\n\n1.  **Core Rules:** It typically defaults to 100. `max_connections` can only be set at server start, and its value on standby servers must be the same or higher than on the master server.\n\n2.  **Connection Strategy:**\n    *   **With Connection Pooling (Recommended):** If using transaction mode pooling, set `max_connections` to a low multiple (2-5x) of the server's core count. If using session mode pooling, set it to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued.\n    *   **Without Connection Pooling:** Set `max_connections` to the required number of concurrent users. This typically means setting it slightly above your application's anticipated peak concurrent connections plus a small buffer (e.g., 10-20) for superuser, replication, and monitoring connections. Values might range up to a few hundred (e.g., 100-500) on well-resourced servers, but be aware that performance may be suboptimal without pooling.\n\n3.  **Memory Constraint:** Critically, regardless of the chosen value, always ensure that the total memory consumed by all connections (estimated at a base of 3-5MB per connection, plus `work_mem` allocated for active queries) remains comfortably within the available system RAM."}
