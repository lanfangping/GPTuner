{'suggestion': 'The `bgwriter_lru_multiplier` parameter, defaulting to 2.0, dictates how aggressively the background writer cleans dirty buffers by multiplying the recent average buffer need; for instance, a setting of 1.0 cleans the predicted need, while the default 2.0 cleans twice that to provide a cushion. If the `buffers_backend` count in `pg_stat_bgwriter` is consistently high (e.g., over 5-10% of total buffers written), consider increasing `bgwriter_lru_multiplier` (e.g., to 3.0 or 4.0). This adjustment allows the background writer to scan more pages and handle more of the dirty buffer writing, potentially reducing write pressure on backend processes.'}
