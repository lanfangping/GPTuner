{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `synchronous_commit` knob specifies how much WAL processing must complete before a transaction success is reported to the client. Options range from `off` (offering maximum performance by not waiting for WAL records to be flushed, but risking loss of transactions committed within up to three times `wal_writer_delay` before a crash), through `on` (the default, providing strong durability by waiting for local WAL flush and, if configured, confirmation from remote synchronous standbys of WAL record writes), to `remote_apply` (ensuring the highest consistency by waiting for synchronous standbys to both write and apply WAL records, making changes visible).'}
