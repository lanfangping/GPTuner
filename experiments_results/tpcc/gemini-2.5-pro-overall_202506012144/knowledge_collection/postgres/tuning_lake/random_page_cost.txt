{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'random_page_cost' knob sets the planner's estimated cost for a non-sequentially-fetched disk page, relative to `seq_page_cost` (which defaults to 1.0). `random_page_cost` defaults to 4.0. This default value is derived from a model assuming that physical random disk I/O is 40 times costlier than sequential I/O, but 90% of random page fetches are expected to be served from cache with negligible additional cost, resulting in an effective cost multiplier of (1-0.9) * 40 = 4.0 relative to `seq_page_cost`. For systems with disk technology having a random access profile similar to SSDs (where the random I/O penalty is much lower), or where the working set of data fits largely in RAM (making most accesses effectively cache hits), this default of 4.0 is generally too high. In such scenarios, you should lower `random_page_cost`. It is often recommended to set it to a value in the 1.x range (e.g., ‘1.2’), with typical settings falling between 1.1 and 1.5, to align it more closely with `seq_page_cost`. This adjustment helps the planner to better reflect the actual reduced penalty of random I/O and encourages more appropriate and effective use of indexes."}
