{'suggestion': "The `enable_indexonlyscan` parameter controls the query planner's use of index-only scans. It defaults to `on` (representing `1` or `true`), which is the recommended setting to allow PostgreSQL to utilize efficient index-only scans. For index-only scans to be considered, `enable_indexscan` must also be `on` (or `1`). You should generally keep `enable_indexonlyscan` enabled; only consider changing it to `off` (e.g., via `SET enable_indexonlyscan = off;` for a session) for temporary debugging or if specific query analysis reveals it causes a performance regression in rare cases."}
