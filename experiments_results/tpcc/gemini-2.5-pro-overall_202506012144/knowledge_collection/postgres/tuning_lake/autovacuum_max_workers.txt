{'suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_max_workers` parameter sets the maximum number of autovacuum worker processes (distinct from the launcher) allowed to run concurrently, defaulting to 3 workers; this limit can only be modified at server startup. If autovacuum consistently struggles to keep up with frequently updated tables, consider cautiously increasing `autovacuum_max_workers` from its default. For instance, you might aim for up to half the number of your CPU cores (e.g., 4 workers on an 8-core system), while carefully monitoring system I/O and CPU load during and after such changes.'}
