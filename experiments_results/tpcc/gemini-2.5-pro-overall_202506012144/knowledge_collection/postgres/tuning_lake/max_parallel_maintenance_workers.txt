{'comprehensive_suggestion': '`max_parallel_maintenance_workers` sets the maximum number of parallel workers (defaulting to 2) that a single utility command, such as `CREATE INDEX` (B-tree) or `VACUUM` (without `FULL`), can utilize. When configuring this parameter, consider, for example, setting it to 2 to 4 workers if your system has 4 to 8 CPU cores. It is crucial that this value does not exceed `max_worker_processes` and that your I/O system has sufficient throughput to handle the increased concurrent workload.'}
