{'suggestion_name': 'Configuration of `enable_seqscan`', 'description': "The `enable_seqscan` parameter, which defaults to 'on', governs whether the query planner can utilize sequential scan plan types. Setting it to 'off' discourages, but does not completely prevent, the use of sequential scans if alternative plans are available.", 'rationale': "It is generally recommended to keep `enable_seqscan` set to 'on'. This allows the PostgreSQL planner to choose sequential scans, which are typically the most efficient access method for small tables (e.g., those under a few dozen data blocks) or when a query needs to retrieve a significant portion (e.g., over 5-10%) of a large table's rows.", 'impact': "The default 'on' setting generally allows the planner to select the most optimal execution plan. Disabling sequential scans by setting `enable_seqscan` to 'off' can restrict the planner's choices, potentially leading to suboptimal performance unless used judiciously for specific problematic queries. It does not guarantee index usage, only makes sequential scans less likely if alternative plans exist.", 'action': "Maintain `enable_seqscan` at its default value of 'on'. Consider setting it to 'off' only in specific, well-understood scenarios, such as for debugging particular query plans or to temporarily force index usage if the planner is consistently making poor choices for a specific query. Remember that 'off' only discourages sequential scans; it doesn't eliminate them if no better alternative plan is found by the planner."}
