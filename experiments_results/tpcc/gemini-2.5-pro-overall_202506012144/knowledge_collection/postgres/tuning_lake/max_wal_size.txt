{'comprehensive_suggestion': '`max_wal_size` defines a soft limit on the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) size, defaulting to 1 GB (interpreted as megabytes if units are unspecified), which triggers an automatic checkpoint when exceeded. It is generally recommended to increase `max_wal_size`, unless disk space is a significant constraint, to ensure automatic checkpoints are primarily triggered by `checkpoint_timeout` rather than WAL size. This helps prevent checkpoints from occurring too frequently, aiming for intervals of 5-30 minutes or longer, especially in write-intensive systems where values like 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, or even higher may be suitable. While larger values reduce checkpoint frequency, they can potentially increase crash recovery time, so a balance must be found considering disk space usage and recovery objectives.'}
