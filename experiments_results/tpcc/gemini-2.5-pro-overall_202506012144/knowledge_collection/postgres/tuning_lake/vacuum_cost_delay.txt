{'suggestion': 'The `vacuum_cost_delay` parameter enables cost-based vacuuming by specifying the sleep duration in milliseconds (e.g., typically less than 1 ms) for which a VACUUM process will pause after its accumulated I/O cost exceeds `vacuum_cost_limit` (default 200 units). This setting primarily affects manual `VACUUM` operations but can also influence autovacuum if `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` (default 2ms) is set to -1, causing autovacuum to inherit the `vacuum_cost_delay` value. On busy systems, it is recommended to reduce `vacuum_cost_delay` to increase background writer activity.'}
