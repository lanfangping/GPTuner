{'suggestion': '`autovacuum_analyze_threshold` sets the minimum count of inserted, updated, or deleted tuples—defaulting to 50—that must occur in a single table before an automatic ANALYZE operation is triggered for it. You might consider lowering this threshold (e.g., to 25) for small, highly active tables to ensure more frequent statistics updates, while keeping the default for most other cases.'}
