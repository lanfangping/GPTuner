{'suggestion': 'The `commit_delay` parameter, measured in microseconds and defaulting to zero (no delay), introduces a configurable pause before a WAL flush is initiated. This delay is typically set to a small value, such as 10 to 200 microseconds (e.g., 100 Âµs), with the aim to potentially enhance group commit throughput by allowing more transactions to be batched together. This mechanism is effective only when `fsync` is enabled and at least `commit_siblings` (which defaults to 5) other transactions are active at the time of a commit. The primary trade-off for using `commit_delay` is an increase in latency for individual transactions by up to the specified delay period.'}
