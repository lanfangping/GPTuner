{'suggestion_summary': 'The `vacuum_cost_page_hit` knob specifies the estimated cost for vacuuming a page already found in the shared buffer cache, which includes locking the buffer pool, looking up the shared hash table, and scanning the page content. It defaults to 1, reflecting the low cost of processing a page already in shared buffers. The recommended setting for `vacuum_cost_page_hit` is its default of 1. However, if autovacuum needs to be more conservative and throttle more readily when encountering pages in cache, consider increasing it slightly, for instance to a value between 2 and 5.'}
