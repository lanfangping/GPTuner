{'suggestion': "The `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age` setting specifies the maximum age, defaulting to 400 million multixacts, that a table's `pg_class.relminmxid` can attain before a VACUUM operation is automatically forced to prevent multixact ID wraparound. It is recommended to maintain this setting at its default value of 400 million. Only consider cautiously increasing it, for instance up to 1 billion, if specific monitoring indicates that very high multixact ID consumption rates are causing excessively frequent or disruptive anti-wraparound autovacuum processes."}
