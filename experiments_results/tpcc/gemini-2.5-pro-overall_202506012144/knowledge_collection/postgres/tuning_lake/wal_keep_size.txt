{'suggestion': '`wal_keep_size` specifies the minimum size of past WAL segments, in megabytes (e.g., 128 MB), retained in the `pg_wal` directory. This setting is crucial to prevent streaming replication termination if a standby server falls behind by more than this amount. To determine an appropriate value, set `wal_keep_size` comfortably larger than the total WAL expected to be generated during the longest anticipated period a streaming replica might be disconnected or lagging, or during the duration of a `pg_basebackup -X stream` operation. For example, if peak WAL generation is 1 GB per hour and a replica could be down or lagging for 4 hours, `wal_keep_size` should be set to a value greater than 4096 MB (e.g., 5120 MB to 6144 MB, corresponding to 5-6 GB, to include a safety margin).'}
