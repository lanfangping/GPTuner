{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `checkpoint_timeout` parameter defines the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints, defaulting to 5 minutes. It is generally recommended to increase this value, for instance, to between 15 minutes and 1 hour. Raising `checkpoint_timeout` allows `max_wal_size` to primarily govern checkpoint frequency, which can lead to better I/O smoothing and, by reducing the aggregate I/O from less frequent checkpoints, typically improves overall I/O usage. However, be aware that larger values can lead to larger I/O spikes during a checkpoint (which may be smoothed by tuning `checkpoint_completion_target` and bgwriter activity) and potentially increase crash recovery time. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that any adjustments still meet your recovery time objective (RTO).'}
