{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'effective_cache_size' setting informs the PostgreSQL query planner about the assumed available disk cache for a single query. Higher values (default is 4GB) make index scans more likely, while lower values favor sequential scans. This value should be set considering PostgreSQL's shared buffers, the kernel's disk cache, and the number of concurrent queries. Importantly, 'effective_cache_size' does not directly affect the amount of physical RAM used by queries; instead, it influences the planner's cost estimates based on this assumed cache availability."}
