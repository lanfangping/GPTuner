{'suggestion': '`max_wal_senders` defines the maximum number of concurrent streaming replication clients (standby servers or backup clients), with a default value of 10. To optimally configure it, set this value to the sum of your total standby/replica servers and concurrent backup processes (e.g., `pg_basebackup`, typically 1-2), plus an additional buffer of 2-5 for flexibility and future growth.'}
