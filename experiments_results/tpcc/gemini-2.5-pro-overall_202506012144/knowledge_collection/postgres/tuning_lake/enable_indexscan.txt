{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `enable_indexscan` knob controls the query planner's use of index-scan and index-only-scan plan types, defaulting to 'on'. It is recommended to maintain this default setting. Consider disabling `enable_indexscan` (setting to 'off') only for specific debugging or testing scenarios, as this prevents the optimizer from selecting these potentially faster access paths."}
