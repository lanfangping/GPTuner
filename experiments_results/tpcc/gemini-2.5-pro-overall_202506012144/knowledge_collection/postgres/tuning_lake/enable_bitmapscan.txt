{'suggestion': "This knob controls the query planner's use of bitmap-scan plan types, with a default setting of `on`. Setting it to `off` disables these plan types. While the default of `on` is generally recommended, consider setting `enable_bitmapscan` to `off` if `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` consistently indicates that bitmap scans are resulting in poor query plans. Such poor performance can sometimes be a consequence of misconfigured related cost parameters, for example, if `random_page_cost` is set significantly lower than its default of `4.0` relative to `seq_page_cost`'s default of `1.0`."}
