{'suggestion': '`work_mem` defines the base maximum memory (defaulting to 4MB, often insufficient for modern systems) allocated to individual query operations like sorts or hash tables before they spill to temporary disk files, impacting performance; note that hash operations can use more, up to `work_mem` multiplied by `hash_mem_multiplier`. Adjust `work_mem` by inspecting query plans (e.g., using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) to ensure operations complete in RAM and avoid disk spills. Consider starting with at least 16MB; values can range from low MBs for simple OLTP queries to 16-128MB or even higher (into the GB range for OLAP-style queries with few concurrent operations). Critically, ensure the total potential memory consumed by concurrent operations (estimated by `work_mem` * `max_connections` * a small factor representing operations per query) does not exhaust available system RAM, as this could destabilize node throughput.'}
