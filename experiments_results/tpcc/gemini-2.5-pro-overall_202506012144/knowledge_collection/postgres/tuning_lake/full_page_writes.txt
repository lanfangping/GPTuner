{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `full_page_writes` parameter, which is `on` by default, ensures data integrity after a system crash. It achieves this by writing the entire content of each disk page (typically 8KB) to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) upon its first modification after a checkpoint. This mechanism prevents data corruption from partial page writes, although it results in increased WAL volume. You should only consider setting `full_page_writes` to `off` if your operating system and filesystem (such as modern Linux with XFS, ext4 in `data=ordered` or `data=journal` mode, or ZFS) guarantee atomic writes for database pages (typically 8KB). Otherwise, it is crucial to leave `full_page_writes` `on` to prevent potential data corruption.'}
