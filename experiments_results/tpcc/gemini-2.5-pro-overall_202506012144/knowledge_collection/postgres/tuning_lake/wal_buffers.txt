{'suggestion': 'The `wal_buffers` knob, set at server start, allocates shared memory for WAL data not yet written to disk. By default, `wal_buffers` is automatically sized to 1/32nd of `shared_buffers`, typically resulting in a value between 64kB and the WAL segment size (often 16MB). For busy servers, especially those with write-intensive workloads, setting `wal_buffers` to at least a few megabytes, or manually increasing it towards the WAL segment size (e.g., trying 8MB or 16MB), can improve write performance. Note that values beyond one WAL segment size rarely provide additional benefit.'}
