{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `transaction_isolation` parameter reflects the current transaction's isolation level (e.g., Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable). This level is initialized from `default_transaction_isolation` at the start of each transaction and can be subsequently changed. For `default_transaction_isolation`, it is generally recommended to use `READ COMMITTED` (representing level 2 of increasing strictness). If application logic absolutely requires stronger protection against phenomena like non-repeatable reads (requiring `REPEATABLE READ`, level 3) or phantom reads (requiring `SERIALIZABLE`, level 4), the level can be changed accordingly. However, be mindful that stricter isolation levels can incur performance overhead or an increased likelihood of serialization failures."}
