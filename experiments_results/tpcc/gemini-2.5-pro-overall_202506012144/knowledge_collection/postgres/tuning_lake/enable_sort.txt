{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `enable_sort` knob, defaulting to `on` (equivalent to `true`), controls whether the query planner actively uses explicit sort operations. Setting `enable_sort` to `off` (equivalent to `false`) discourages, but does not entirely suppress, such explicit sort steps if other ordering methods are available. It is generally recommended to keep `enable_sort` `on`; only consider setting it to `off` in very rare, specific, and thoroughly tested scenarios, for example, if an existing index already provides the required order and the planner is making a suboptimal choice for a query affecting a very small percentage of workloads (e.g., less than 1%).'}
