{'suggestion': 'It is advisable to increase the `vacuum_cost_limit` parameter, typically from its default of 200 to 1000 or more. Raising this parameter generally improves overall I/O usage, as it can contribute to scenarios with less frequent checkpointing, thereby reducing aggregate I/O compared to situations with more frequent checkpoints. Specifically for `vacuum_cost_limit`, this increase allows autovacuum workers to perform more I/O before pausing, making them more aggressive in cleaning up dead tuples. However, a higher `vacuum_cost_limit` may cause larger I/O spikes during autovacuum (these might be smoothed by tuning `checkpoint_completion_target` and `bgwriter activity`) and could potentially increase recovery time after a database crash.'}
