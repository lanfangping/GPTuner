{'suggestion': "`seq_page_cost` sets the planner's estimated cost of a sequential disk page fetch, with a default value of 1.0. It is generally recommended to maintain this value, ensuring it remains less than or equal to `random_page_cost` (which itself might be adjusted from its default of 4.0, for instance, down to 1.1-2.0 for fast SSDs)."}
