{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `enable_hashjoin` knob controls if the query planner uses hash-join plan types. Its default setting, which enables their use, is recommended for optimal performance in most scenarios. While the alternative setting disables them, doing so should only be considered as a last resort for specific problematic queries or if `work_mem` is severely restricted (e.g., to 1MB or less) and cannot be increased, as this forces potentially less efficient join methods.'}
