{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'To discourage the query planner from using nested-loop joins if alternative methods exist, consider setting `enable_nestloop` to `off`. This approach can be particularly beneficial for specific, problematic queries involving large tables (e.g., with over 10,000 to 100,000 rows) where the planner might wrongly estimate nested-loop joins as the cheapest option, leading to significant performance degradation. Note that this change cannot entirely suppress nested-loop joins.'}
