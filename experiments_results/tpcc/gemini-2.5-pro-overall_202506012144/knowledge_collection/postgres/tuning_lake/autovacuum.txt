{'suggestion': "The 'autovacuum' configuration parameter controls the server's autovacuum launcher daemon, which requires 'track_counts' to be enabled for its operation. It is highly recommended to ensure `autovacuum` is set to `on` (this is the default value). When `autovacuum` is enabled, its performance can be further optimized for more frequent and less disruptive background vacuuming by adjusting related settings such as:\n- Lowering `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` (e.g., from the default of 0.2 to a value between 0.05 and 0.1).\n- Reducing `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` (e.g., from 20ms to 2ms; note that 2ms is the default on newer PostgreSQL versions, while older versions might default to 20ms).\n- Increasing `maintenance_work_mem` for autovacuum workers (e.g., to a range of 128MB to 1GB).\nIt's important to note that, as a failsafe mechanism, PostgreSQL will still initiate autovacuum processes if they are essential to prevent transaction ID wraparound, even if the main `autovacuum` launcher daemon is not running (e.g., if 'autovacuum' were explicitly set to 'off'). For more details on transaction ID wraparound, refer to Section 24.1.5 of the PostgreSQL documentation."}
