{'merged_suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` specifies the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples (default 50) that must accumulate in any one table before an autovacuum VACUUM operation is triggered. For very large tables, such as multi-terabyte ones, this threshold is often increased substantially (e.g., from 1,000 to potentially 1,000,000+) to ensure that autovacuum operations are not excessively delayed by the `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` alone.'}
