{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `wal_sync_method` knob configures which of its 5 distinct methods (e.g., `fdatasync`, `fsync`, `open_datasync`) is used to force Write-Ahead Log (WAL) updates to disk. This setting is crucial for data durability and is only relevant when the global `fsync` parameter is enabled. For the highest data safety, setting `wal_sync_method` to `fsync` is recommended. Alternatively, after thorough benchmarking on your specific OS and hardware, you might select a potentially faster, OS-dependent alternative. Options to consider for benchmarking include `fdatasync` (which is often the default and faster choice on Linux/FreeBSD if `wal_sync_method` is unspecified) or `open_sync` from the available OS-dependent options.'}
