{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_naptime` parameter specifies the minimum delay between autovacuum runs on any given database, defaulting to one minute (1min). If specified without units, the value is taken as seconds. This value can be decreased (e.g., to 15-30 seconds) if you have a very large number of databases (e.g., >50-100) to ensure each is checked reasonably often, or increased if autovacuum activity is too frequent for a low-write workload.'}
