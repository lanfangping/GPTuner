{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `bgwriter_delay` parameter specifies the sleep duration between background writer activity rounds for flushing dirty buffers to disk. It defaults to 200ms and is typically effective in millisecond increments. On busy or write-intensive systems, consider cautiously reducing this delay (e.g., towards values in a range such as 10ms to 100ms, from the default 200ms) to increase background writer activity. This adjustment may be particularly indicated if `pg_stat_bgwriter` statistics reveal a high number of `buffers_backend` (buffers written by backends) or `buffers_checkpoint` (buffers written during checkpoints). It is crucial to carefully monitor overall I/O performance after any change to ensure it is beneficial and does not negatively impact system performance.'}
