{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The PostgreSQL `huge_pages` parameter controls the use of huge pages for the main shared memory area, aiming to enhance performance by reducing page table size and CPU overhead. It offers three settings: `off` (disables the use of huge pages); `try` (this is the default setting, where PostgreSQL attempts to use huge pages but starts normally if unavailable); and `on` (PostgreSQL requires huge pages for startup, and startup will fail if they cannot be allocated). The `on` setting should be considered if you are experienced with system administration and have correctly pre-configured the operating system. Effective use of huge pages, particularly with `try` or `on`, necessitates proper operating system configuration. Generally, ensure a sufficient number of huge pages are allocated at the OS level, calculated as `ceil(PostgreSQL's shared_buffers_size / OS_huge_page_size)` (e.g., for 8GB `shared_buffers` and 2MB OS huge pages, at least 4096 huge pages are required). On Linux, `shared_memory_type` must be set to `mmap` in `postgresql.conf`, and huge pages must be allocated, typically configured via `sysctl`. On Windows, the PostgreSQL service account must be granted the 'Lock Pages in Memory' user right."}
