{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `max_slot_wal_keep_size` parameter specifies the maximum total size of WAL files, in megabytes by default, that replication slots can retain in the `pg_wal` directory at checkpoint time. Exceeding a configured value (e.g., 64MB) can cause lagging standbys to fail replication due to WAL removal. When setting a finite value for this parameter, it should be chosen to accommodate the amount of WAL generated during the longest anticipated replica downtime or acceptable lag period, ensuring this size is safely below the total capacity of the `pg_wal` disk partition to prevent it from filling up. Alternatively, the parameter can be configured for unlimited WAL retention.'}
