{'suggestion': 'The `enable_material` knob (default: `on`, often represented as 1 or `true`) controls whether the query planner uses materialization. When `on`, the planner uses materialization freely, allowing it to store and reuse intermediate query results. When set to `off` (often represented as 0 or `false`), its use is restricted to only cases required for correctness. Consider setting `enable_material` to `off` if specific queries consistently perform worse due to the planner inappropriately choosing materialization.'}
