{'suggestion': 'The `commit_siblings` knob, defaulting to five, specifies the minimum number of concurrent open transactions required before `commit_delay` is applied, which increases the probability of group commits. When `synchronous_commit` is enabled, maintain this default of five. However, for very high concurrent transaction commit rates where improved overall throughput is desired, consider increasing `commit_siblings` (e.g., towards 10-50), accepting potentially slightly increased latency for individual leading transactions.'}
