{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `enable_partition_pruning` knob, which defaults to `on` (equivalent to `true` or `1`), controls whether the query planner can exclude unneeded partitions from query plans (e.g., by eliminating them from scans) and the executor can ignore these partitions during execution. Setting this knob to `off` (equivalent to `false` or `0`) disables this partition pruning optimization. Further details can be found in Section 5.11.4.'}
