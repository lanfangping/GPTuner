{'suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` specifies the cost delay for automatic VACUUM operations, defaulting to 2 milliseconds (ms); it is taken as milliseconds if specified without units. If autovacuum is causing excessive I/O load, consider increasing this value to 5ms, 10ms, or 20ms. Conversely, if autovacuum is not aggressive enough to keep up with table bloat or transaction ID wraparound concerns, you might cautiously decrease it towards 0-1ms, often in conjunction with tuning `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit`.'}
