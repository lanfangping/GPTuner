{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'To further increase the activity of the background writer on busy databases and minimize backend processes having to write out dirty buffers themselves, consider increasing `bgwriter_lru_maxpages`. On busy systems, setting this value to a range of 200 to 1000 pages (default is 100) is often beneficial. The aim is to keep the `buffers_backend` count in `pg_stat_bgwriter` consistently low, indicating that the background writer is effectively cleaning pages.'}
