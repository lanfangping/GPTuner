{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'To optimize database maintenance, set `maintenance_work_mem` to a value significantly larger than its default. This will accelerate tasks such as `VACUUM`, `CREATE INDEX`, and index rebuilds by allowing these operations to utilize more memory. It is particularly recommended to increase this setting notably when the server has large RAM resources and handles frequent write operations. As a guideline, consider starting with 256MB-1GB for smaller databases. For larger databases with plentiful memory, and provided that maintenance operations are not highly concurrent, this can be increased to 1GB-4GB. Crucially, be aware that unless `autovacuum_work_mem` is specifically configured, `maintenance_work_mem` also determines the amount of memory each autovacuum worker may use.'}
