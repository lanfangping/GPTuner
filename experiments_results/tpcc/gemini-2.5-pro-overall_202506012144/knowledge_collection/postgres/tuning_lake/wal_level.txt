{'suggestion': 'The `wal_level` parameter dictates the amount of information written to the Write-Ahead Log. The `minimal` level provides basic crash recovery; the `replica` level (default from PostgreSQL 9.6+) enables WAL archiving (for point-in-time recovery) and replication (including streaming replication); and the `logical` level adds support for logical decoding, which is required for logical replication.'}
