{'suggestion': '`vacuum_cost_page_dirty` sets the estimated cost, defaulting to 20, for vacuum modifying a previously clean block, reflecting the extra I/O needed to flush that dirty block back to disk. This value is typically higher than `vacuum_cost_page_miss` (default 10) and helps make autovacuum more conservative when it needs to modify pages.'}
