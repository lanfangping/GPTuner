{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `log_min_duration_statement` parameter logs the duration of completed SQL statements that run for at least the specified threshold in milliseconds. By default, this feature is disabled. A common starting point is `250ms`, meaning statements executing for 250 milliseconds or longer will be logged. If set to `0`, all statement durations are logged; however, this is strongly discouraged for busy servers due to significant performance impact and large log volumes, and should only be used for low-traffic services. It is advisable to find a reasonable threshold for your application, such as `250ms` or `1000ms` (1 second), and then adjust it: decrease it (e.g., to `100ms`) for more detailed logging, or increase it (e.g., to `5000ms`) if log volume becomes excessive. For comprehensive query performance insights, consider using tools like `pg_stat_statements` or `pg_stat_monitor`.'}
