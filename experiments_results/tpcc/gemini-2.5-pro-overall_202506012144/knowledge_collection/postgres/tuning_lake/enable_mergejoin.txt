{'suggestion': "The `enable_mergejoin` knob in PostgreSQL, which is on by default, enables the query planner's use of merge-join plan types, allowing it to consider merge join strategies. It should typically be left on, and only set to `off` if specific performance issues indicate the planner is consistently making suboptimal choices by selecting merge joins."}
