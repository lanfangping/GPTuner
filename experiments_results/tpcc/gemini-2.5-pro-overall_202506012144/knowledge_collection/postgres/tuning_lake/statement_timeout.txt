{'suggestion': 'The `statement_timeout` knob aborts statements exceeding a specified duration, interpreted in milliseconds if units are omitted (e.g., `5000` for 5 seconds). Setting this globally in `postgresql.conf` is not recommended. Instead, individual sessions can set their own timeout using `SET statement_timeout = value_in_ms;` for specific needs, such as `5000` (5 seconds) for interactive tasks.'}
