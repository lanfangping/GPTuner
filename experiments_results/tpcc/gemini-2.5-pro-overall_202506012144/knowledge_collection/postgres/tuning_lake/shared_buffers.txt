{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The `shared_buffers` configuration parameter determines the amount of memory PostgreSQL uses for shared memory buffers, typically defaulting to 128MB. For dedicated database servers with 1GB or more of RAM, a recommended starting point for `shared_buffers` is 25% of the total system RAM, and it's generally advised not to exceed 40% to ensure good performance. On non-dedicated servers, or when multiple PostgreSQL instances are running, this value should be adjusted downwards as each instance will reserve its own memory. It is crucial to perform your own benchmarks by varying this parameter to find the optimal setting for your specific workload. If `shared_buffers` is set to a very large value (e.g., hundreds of GBs), consider configuring huge pages for better performance. This setting is also related to the OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. Importantly, always ensure that sufficient memory is left available for the operating system's cache and other processes."}
