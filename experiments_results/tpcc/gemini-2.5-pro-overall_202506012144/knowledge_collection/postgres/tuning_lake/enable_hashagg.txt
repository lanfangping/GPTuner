{'comprehensive_suggestion': "The 'enable_hashagg' knob, which is 'on' by default, controls if the query planner can use hashed aggregation plan types. Keeping this enabled allows the planner to use generally faster hash aggregation. For optimal performance and to prevent disk spilling, ensure `work_mem` is adequately sized (e.g., typically 64MB to 256MB or more per concurrent aggregation operation) to hold hash tables in memory."}
