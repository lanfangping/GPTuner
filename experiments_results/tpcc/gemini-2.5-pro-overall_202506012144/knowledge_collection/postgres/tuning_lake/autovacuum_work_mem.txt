{'suggestion': 'The `autovacuum_work_mem` parameter specifies the maximum memory, in kilobytes if unitless, for each autovacuum worker process. By default, autovacuum workers use the `maintenance_work_mem` setting. If you configure `autovacuum_work_mem` with a dedicated value, consider 64MB to 256MB per worker for typical systems. On very large, high-churn systems, this can be increased up to 1GB, as the memory effectively usable for dead tuple collection is often considered capped at 1GB per worker. Regardless of the individual setting, ensure the total memory used by all workers (`autovacuum_max_workers` * `autovacuum_work_mem`) remains a safe fraction of available system RAM.'}
