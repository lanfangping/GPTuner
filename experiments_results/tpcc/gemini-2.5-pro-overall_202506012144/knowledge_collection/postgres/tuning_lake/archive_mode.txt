{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'The `archive_mode` parameter controls the archiving of completed Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) segments using the `archive_command`. It offers three settings:\n- `off` (default): Disables WAL archiving. This setting is suitable for databases that are not a source of truth or are used for testing, where minimizing storage usage is a priority.\n- `on`: Enables WAL archiving during normal server operation. This is the recommended practice for environments requiring point-in-time recovery (PITR), replication, backups, and data consistency. The `archive_command` must be configured when `archive_mode` is set to `on`.\n- `always`: Enables WAL archiving during normal operation, as well as in recovery and standby modes. This ensures WAL segments are archived even when the server is not in its primary operational state.\nAny changes to the `archive_mode` setting require a server restart to take effect.'}
