{'comprehensive_suggestion': '`max_parallel_workers` defines the maximum number of workers available for parallel operations, with a default value of 8. It is advisable to set this value to approximately the number of CPU cores available to PostgreSQL. This parameter also limits `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`. Note that `max_parallel_workers` cannot be set higher than `max_worker_processes` (which also defaults to 8); if you intend to increase `max_parallel_workers`, `max_worker_processes` might need to be increased as well.'}
