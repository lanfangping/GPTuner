{'suggestion': "The `default_statistics_target` sets the default level of detail for column statistics (defaulting to 100) for columns without specific targets. Consider increasing this value globally—for instance, to around 200 for medium-sized systems, or 500-1000 for large systems—if query plans are suboptimal due to inaccurate cardinality estimates, especially with large tables, skewed data distributions, or columns frequently used in complex predicates. For specific problematic columns, an even higher target can be set via `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS`. While higher values may improve query plans, they will also increase `ANALYZE` time, so it's crucial to understand and balance these effects."}
