{'comprehensive_suggestion': "`min_wal_size` ensures that a minimum amount of WAL disk space, defaulting to 80MB, is reserved by recycling old WAL files at checkpoints rather than removing them, as long as total WAL usage stays below this threshold (`min_wal_size`), to accommodate spikes in WAL generation. The default of 80MB is often considered very low; unless you have significant disk space restrictions, consider increasing `min_wal_size` to around 1GB. This practice helps ensure WAL disk usage doesn't drop below this configured floor after a checkpoint, providing a buffer to smooth out WAL generation spikes and prevent overly frequent recycling of WAL files."}
