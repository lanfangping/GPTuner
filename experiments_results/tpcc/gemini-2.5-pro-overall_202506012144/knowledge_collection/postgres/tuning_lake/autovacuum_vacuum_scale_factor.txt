{'comprehensive_suggestion': 'Review and adjust `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor`. The global default value is often considered very low; consider raising this global factor to make global autovacuum less frequent, unless disk space is severely restricted. For specific large (e.g., >10GB) or frequently updated tables, however, set a lower `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` on a per-table basis. This ensures these tables are vacuumed more frequently, triggering when a smaller percentage of their rows are dead, to effectively manage bloat.'}
