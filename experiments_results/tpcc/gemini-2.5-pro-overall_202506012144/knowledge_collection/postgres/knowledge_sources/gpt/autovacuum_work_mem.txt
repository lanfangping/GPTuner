If not using the default of -1 (which makes autovacuum workers use `maintenance_work_mem`), set `autovacuum_work_mem` to a dedicated value, typically between 64MB and 256MB per worker, potentially up to 1GB-2GB on very large, high-churn systems, ensuring the total memory used by all workers (`autovacuum_max_workers` * `autovacuum_work_mem`) remains a safe fraction of available system RAM.
