Increase `default_statistics_target` globally from its default (typically 100) to a higher value, such as 200, 500, or up to 1000 (or even higher for specific problematic columns via `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS`), if query plans are suboptimal due to inaccurate cardinality estimates for columns with skewed data distributions or those frequently used in complex predicates.
