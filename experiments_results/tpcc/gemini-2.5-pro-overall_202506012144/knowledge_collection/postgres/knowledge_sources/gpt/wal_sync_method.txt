Set `wal_sync_method` to `fsync` for the highest data safety, or, after thorough benchmarking on your specific OS and hardware, select a potentially faster alternative like `fdatasync` (often the default and faster choice on Linux/FreeBSD if `wal_sync_method` is unspecified) or `open_sync` from the typically 3 to 5 available OS-dependent options (e.g., common ones include `fsync`, `fdatasync`, `open_sync`, `open_datasync`, and `fsync_writethrough` on Windows).
