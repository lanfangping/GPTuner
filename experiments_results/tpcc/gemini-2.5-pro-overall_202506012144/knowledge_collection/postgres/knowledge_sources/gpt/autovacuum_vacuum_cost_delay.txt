To set `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay`, start with its default (typically 2ms in modern PostgreSQL), increasing it to values like 5ms, 10ms, or 20ms if autovacuum is causing excessive I/O load, or cautiously decreasing it towards 0-1ms (often in conjunction with tuning `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit`) if autovacuum is not aggressive enough to keep up with table bloat or transaction ID wraparound concerns.
