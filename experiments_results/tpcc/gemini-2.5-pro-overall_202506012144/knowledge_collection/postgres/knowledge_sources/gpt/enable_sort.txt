Set `enable_sort` to `on` (the default, equivalent to `true` or a numerical `1`) to allow the query planner to use explicit sort operations, and only consider setting it to `off` (equivalent to `false` or `0`) in very rare, specific, and thoroughly tested scenarios where you want to prevent the planner from choosing a sort, for instance, if an index already provides the required order and the planner is making a suboptimal choice for a query affecting less than 1% of workloads.
