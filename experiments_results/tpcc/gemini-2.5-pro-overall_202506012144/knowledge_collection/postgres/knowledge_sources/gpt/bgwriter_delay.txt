Set `bgwriter_delay` starting with the default of 200ms, and consider cautiously reducing it, for example towards a range of 10ms to 100ms, on write-intensive systems if `pg_stat_bgwriter` statistics reveal a high number of `buffers_backend` (buffers written by backends) or `buffers_checkpoint` (buffers written during checkpoints), while carefully monitoring overall I/O performance to ensure the change is beneficial.
