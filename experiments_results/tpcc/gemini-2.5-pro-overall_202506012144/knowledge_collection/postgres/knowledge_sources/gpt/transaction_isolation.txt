Set `transaction_isolation` to the default `READ COMMITTED` (representing level 2 of 4 increasing strictness levels), only escalating to `REPEATABLE READ` (level 3) or `SERIALIZABLE` (level 4) if application logic absolutely requires stronger protection against phenomena like non-repeatable or phantom reads, respectively, and can tolerate the associated performance overhead or increased likelihood of serialization failures.
