Set `vacuum_cost_delay` to a sleep duration in milliseconds (default 0ms, with common active values for throttling ranging from 5-20ms) for which a VACUUM process will pause after accumulating `vacuum_cost_limit` (default 200) I/O cost units, primarily affecting manual `VACUUM` operations or autovacuum if `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` (default 2ms) is set to -1 to inherit this value.
