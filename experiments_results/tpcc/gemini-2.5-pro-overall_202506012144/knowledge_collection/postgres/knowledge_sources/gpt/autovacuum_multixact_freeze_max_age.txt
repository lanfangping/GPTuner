Set `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age` to its default of 400 million, and only consider cautiously increasing it, for instance up to 1 billion (while ensuring it remains significantly below the ~2 billion system limit), if specific monitoring indicates that very high multixact ID consumption rates are causing excessively frequent or disruptive anti-wraparound autovacuum processes.
