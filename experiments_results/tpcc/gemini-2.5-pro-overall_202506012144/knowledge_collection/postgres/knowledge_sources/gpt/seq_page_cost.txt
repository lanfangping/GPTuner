Set `seq_page_cost` to its default value of 1.0, representing the planner's estimate for fetching one disk page sequentially, and generally maintain this value, ensuring it remains less than or equal to `random_page_cost` (which itself might be adjusted from a default of 4.0 down to 1.1-2.0 for fast SSDs).
