Leave `enable_seqscan` `on` (the default value) to allow the PostgreSQL planner to choose sequential scans, which are typically most efficient for small tables (e.g., under a few dozen data blocks) or when retrieving a significant portion (e.g., over 5-10%) of a large table's rows, and only set it to `off` for specific debugging or to temporarily force index usage if the planner is making a consistently poor choice for a particular query.
