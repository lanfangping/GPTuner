Set `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` to a duration, commonly starting around 5 minutes (300,000 ms) but adjustable (e.g., 1 to 15 minutes, or 60,000 ms to 900,000 ms), that exceeds typical interactive user pauses within a transaction yet is short enough to reclaim resources from abandoned sessions holding locks.
