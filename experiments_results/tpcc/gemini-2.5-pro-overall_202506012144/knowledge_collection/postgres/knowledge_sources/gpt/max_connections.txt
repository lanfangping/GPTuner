Set `max_connections` to slightly above your application's anticipated peak concurrent connections plus a small buffer (e.g., 10-20 for superuser/replication/monitoring), typically ranging from a few dozen (e.g., 20-50) if using a connection pooler, up to a few hundred (e.g., 100-500) for direct connections on well-resourced servers, always ensuring that the total memory consumed (roughly 3-5MB base per connection plus `work_mem` for active queries) remains comfortably within available system RAM.
