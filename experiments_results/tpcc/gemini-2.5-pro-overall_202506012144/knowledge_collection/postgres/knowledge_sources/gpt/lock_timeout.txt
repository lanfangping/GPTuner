Set `lock_timeout` in milliseconds to a value reflecting your application's acceptable delay before a statement errors out due to a lock conflict, typically a few seconds like `1000`ms (1 second) to `5000`ms (5 seconds) for interactive sessions, or potentially longer, such as `30000`ms (30 seconds), for specific batch operations.
