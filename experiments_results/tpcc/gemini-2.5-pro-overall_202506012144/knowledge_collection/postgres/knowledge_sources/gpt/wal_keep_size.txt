Set `wal_keep_size` to a value comfortably larger than the total WAL generated during the longest anticipated period a streaming replica might be disconnected or lagging, or the duration of a `pg_basebackup -X stream` operation; for example, if peak WAL generation is 1 GB/hour and a replica could be down/lagging for 4 hours, set it above 4 GB (e.g., 5-6 GB to include a safety margin).
