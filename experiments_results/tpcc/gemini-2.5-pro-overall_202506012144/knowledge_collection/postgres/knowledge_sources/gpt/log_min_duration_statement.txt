Set `log_min_duration_statement` to a value in milliseconds, often starting with a moderate value like `250ms` or `500ms` to capture noticeably slow queries, and adjust it downwards (e.g., to `100ms`) for more detail or upwards (e.g., to `1000ms` or `5000ms`) if log volume is too high; use `0` to log all statements for deep debugging but be very cautious due to performance impact and log size.
