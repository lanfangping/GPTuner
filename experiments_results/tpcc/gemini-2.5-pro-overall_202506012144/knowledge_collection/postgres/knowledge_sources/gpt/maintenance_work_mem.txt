Set `maintenance_work_mem` to a value significantly larger than its default to allow individual maintenance operations like `VACUUM` or `CREATE INDEX` to hold more data in memory and run faster, commonly starting around 256MB-1GB for smaller databases and potentially increasing to 1GB-4GB or even up to 5-10% of total RAM for larger databases if memory is plentiful and such operations are not highly concurrent.
