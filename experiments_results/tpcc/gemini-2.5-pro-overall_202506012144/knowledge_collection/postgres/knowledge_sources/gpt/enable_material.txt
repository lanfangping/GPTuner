Set `enable_material` to `on` (the default, effectively `1` or `true`) to allow the query planner to store and reuse intermediate query results, and only consider changing it to `off` (effectively `0` or `false`) if specific queries consistently perform worse due to the planner inappropriately choosing materialization.
