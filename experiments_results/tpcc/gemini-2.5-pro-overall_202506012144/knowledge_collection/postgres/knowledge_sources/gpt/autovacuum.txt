Ensure `autovacuum` is set to `on` (the default), then tune its behavior for more frequent and less disruptive operation by adjusting related settings, such as lowering `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` from the default 0.2 towards 0.05-0.1, reducing `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` (e.g., from 20ms to 2ms if on older PostgreSQL, or keeping it at 2ms on newer versions), and increasing `maintenance_work_mem` for autovacuum workers (e.g., to 128MB-1GB).
