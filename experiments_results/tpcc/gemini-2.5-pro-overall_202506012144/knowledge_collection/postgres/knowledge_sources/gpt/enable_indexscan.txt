Keep `enable_indexscan` set to its default value of `on` (which can be represented as `1` or `true`), and only consider setting it to `off` (represented as `0` or `false`) for highly specific debugging or testing scenarios, as disabling it prevents the optimizer from choosing potentially faster index scan access paths.
