Set `autovacuum_naptime` to control the interval between autovacuum daemon checks, which defaults to 60 seconds (1 minute) and can be decreased (e.g., to 15-30 seconds) if you have a very large number of databases (e.g., >50-100) to ensure each is checked reasonably often, or increased if autovacuum activity is too frequent for a low-write workload.
