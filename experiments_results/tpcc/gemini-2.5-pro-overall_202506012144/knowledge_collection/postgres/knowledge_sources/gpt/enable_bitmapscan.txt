You should generally leave `enable_bitmapscan` set to `on` (its default value), but consider setting it to `off` if `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` consistently shows it results in poor query plans, which can sometimes occur if related cost parameters like `random_page_cost` are misconfigured (e.g., set significantly lower than its default of `4.0` relative to `seq_page_cost`'s default of `1.0`).
