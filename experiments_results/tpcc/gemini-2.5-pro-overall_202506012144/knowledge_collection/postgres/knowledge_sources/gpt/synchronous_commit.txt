Set `synchronous_commit` to `on` (default) for strong durability by waiting for local WAL flush and remote synchronous standby write confirmation (if configured), `remote_apply` for the highest consistency by also awaiting standby application, or `off` for maximum performance at the risk of losing transactions committed within approximately the last `wal_writer_delay` interval (default 200ms) if a server crash occurs before the WAL is flushed.
