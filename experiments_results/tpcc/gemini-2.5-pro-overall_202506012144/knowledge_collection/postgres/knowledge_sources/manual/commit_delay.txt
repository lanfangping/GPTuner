The `commit_delay` setting (default 0 microseconds) introduces a configurable time delay, such as 100 microseconds, before initiating a WAL flush to improve group commit throughput by batching more transactions, but only if `fsync` is enabled and at least `commit_siblings` (e.g., 5) other transactions are active, at the cost of increasing individual transaction latency by up to this delay.
