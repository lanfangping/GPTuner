### Comprehensive Suggestion:

The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` parameter, which defaults to 2 milliseconds, controls the delay for automatic VACUUM operations in PostgreSQL. This setting can be adjusted in the `postgresql.conf` file or via the server command line, and it can also be overridden for specific tables. To balance vacuuming performance and database load, consider setting `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` to a range between 10ms and 20ms, with lower values (e.g., 10ms) recommended for high-throughput systems and higher values (e.g., 20ms) for less critical workloads.
