**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

The `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` parameter, which is set in the `postgresql.conf` file or server command line, triggers a VACUUM operation in a table after a specified number of tuples have been inserted. The default threshold is set at 1000 tuples. This parameter can be adjusted for individual tables by modifying the table storage parameters.
