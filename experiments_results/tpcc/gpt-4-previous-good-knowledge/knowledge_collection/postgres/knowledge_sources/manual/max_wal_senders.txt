The 'max_wal_senders' knob specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections from standby servers or streaming base backup clients, with a default of 10, and should be set slightly higher than the maximum number of expected clients to allow for immediate reconnection in case of abrupt disconnection; it can only be set at server start and requires 'wal_level' to be set to replica or higher.
