The 'track_functions' knob enables the tracking of function call counts and time used, with options to track only procedural-language functions ('pl'), SQL and C language functions ('all'), or disable function statistics tracking ('none' - the default setting), and can only be changed by superusers, while simple SQL-language functions inlined into the calling query are not tracked.
