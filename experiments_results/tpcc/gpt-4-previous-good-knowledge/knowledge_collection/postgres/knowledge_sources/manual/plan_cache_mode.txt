The `plan_cache_mode` knob allows you to control whether prepared statements use custom plans (created afresh for each execution based on parameter values) or generic plans (re-used across executions, saving planning time but potentially being less efficient if the optimal plan depends on parameter values), with options including `auto` (default), `force_custom_plan`, and `force_generic_plan`, and is applied at execution time, not preparation.
