The 'effective_cache_size' knob sets the planner's assumption about the size of the disk cache available to a single query, influencing the use of index or sequential scans, considering both PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel's disk cache for PostgreSQL data files, without affecting the size of shared memory allocated by PostgreSQL or reserving kernel disk cache. The default value is 4 gigabytes (4GB), and if specified without units, it is taken as blocks, typically 8kB.
