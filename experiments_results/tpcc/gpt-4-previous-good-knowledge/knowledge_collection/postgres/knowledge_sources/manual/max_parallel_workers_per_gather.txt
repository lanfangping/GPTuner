The 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' knob sets the maximum number of workers, default value being 2, that can be started by a single Gather or Gather Merge node, taken from the pool established by max_worker_processes and limited by max_parallel_workers, with the caveat that the requested number of workers may not be available at run time, potentially leading to inefficiency, and that parallel queries may significantly increase resource utilization.
