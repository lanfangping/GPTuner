{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'enable_seqscan' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its function: it enables or disables the planner's use of sequential scan plans. 3. Recognize that setting it to 'off' (equivalent to 'false') disables sequential scans, forcing the planner to use other scan methods if possible. 4. Note that 'on' (equivalent to 'true') is the default, allowing the planner to use sequential scans when it deems them appropriate. 5. Determine that 'enable_seqscan' does not have a numerical value that breaks its natural order but has a boolean nature, making it a special knob in terms of functionality rather than numerical order.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "off"}
