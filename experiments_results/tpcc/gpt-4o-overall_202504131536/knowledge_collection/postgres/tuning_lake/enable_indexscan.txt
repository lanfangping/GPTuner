{'suggestion': "The 'enable_indexscan' knob in PostgreSQL allows the query planner to consider using both index-scan and index-only-scan plans. By default, it is set to 'on,' enabling index scans. This setting can be adjusted using the SQL command `SET enable_indexscan TO {on|off}`. Setting it to 'off' forces the database to ignore index scans, which can be useful for testing performance behavior without indexes."}
