{'suggestion': "Configure the 'wal_sync_method' parameter in PostgreSQL to ensure both crash safety and performance. This parameter determines the method used for forcing WAL updates to disk, with possible values including 'open_datasync', 'fdatasync', 'fsync', 'fsync_writethrough', and 'open_sync'. The default setting is platform-specific, typically 'fdatasync' for Linux and FreeBSD. It is crucial to set this parameter carefully in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line, aligning with your system's operating system and hardware. For Linux systems, 'fsync' is commonly used, while 'fdatasync' is typical for macOS. Additionally, 'open_datasync' might offer better performance on some Linux systems, but it is not universally available."}
