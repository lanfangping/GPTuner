{'suggestion': "The 'fsync' parameter in PostgreSQL should generally be enabled to ensure data is reliably written to disk, preventing corruption after crashes. Disabling 'fsync' can improve performance but significantly increases the risk of data loss. Therefore, it should only be turned off in environments where data loss is acceptable, such as disposable databases or systems that can be restored from external sources. If you choose to disable it, careful steps are required to revert this setting, such as using `initdb --sync-only`. This parameter is configured in the `postgresql.conf` file or via the server command line."}
