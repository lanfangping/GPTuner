{'suggestion': "To configure 'autovacuum_work_mem' in PostgreSQL, set the value to specify the memory limit for each autovacuum worker process in kilobytes. The default is -1, which uses 'maintenance_work_mem', and it is crucial to remember that it cannot exceed 1GB for collecting dead tuple identifiers, as values above this limit will not improve efficiency. Ensure the allocation is suitable for the workload size and available system memory, especially if extensive autovacuum operations are anticipated."}
