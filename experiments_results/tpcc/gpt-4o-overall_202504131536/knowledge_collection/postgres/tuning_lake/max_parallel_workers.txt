{'comprehensive_suggestion': "To optimize the 'max_parallel_workers' setting in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to adjust it in conjunction with 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers' and 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather', ensuring that it does not exceed 'max_worker_processes'. The default value is 8, but adjustments should consider system capabilities and workload characteristics. It is advisable to align 'max_parallel_workers' with the number of CPU cores available, typically starting from 2 to 4 for moderate workloads, while ensuring it does not exceed the limits set by 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather'."}
