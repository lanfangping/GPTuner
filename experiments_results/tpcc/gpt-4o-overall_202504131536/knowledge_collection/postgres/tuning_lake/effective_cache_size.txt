{'suggestion': "Set the 'effective_cache_size' parameter in PostgreSQL to estimate the available disk cache size for a single query, influencing the planner's preference for index scans over sequential scans. This setting should be approximately system RAM minus (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) * 1.1, or a lower value if the server is not exclusively dedicated to PostgreSQL. While the default setting is 4 gigabytes, this is typically represented as blocks of 8kB. Note that this value is for estimation purposes only and does not affect the actual physical RAM used by queries."}
