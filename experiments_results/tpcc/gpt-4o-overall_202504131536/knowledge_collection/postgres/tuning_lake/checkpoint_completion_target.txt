{'suggestion': "To configure the 'checkpoint_completion_target' in PostgreSQL, set this parameter in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. It defines the goal for completing checkpoints as a fraction of the interval time between them. While the default value is 0.5, it is suggested to adjust this value between 0.5 and 0.9. Setting it closer to 0.9 can help to evenly distribute checkpoint I/O and minimize performance spikes, especially in development environments. However, if you rely on this setting for non-streaming replicas, consider using a lower percentage to ensure optimal performance."}
