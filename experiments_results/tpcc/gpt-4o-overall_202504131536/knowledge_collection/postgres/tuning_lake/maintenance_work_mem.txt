{'suggestion': "For optimal performance of maintenance tasks in PostgreSQL, such as VACUUM and CREATE INDEX, configure the 'maintenance_work_mem' parameter with careful consideration. Start with the default setting of 64MB, but consider increasing it to leverage larger RAM resources, especially if your system handles extensive write operations. Be mindful that while larger settings can enhance performance, they also increase memory usage by autovacuum processes, which can allocate memory up to the 'autovacuum_max_workers' times this value. Additionally, note that VACUUM's dead tuple collection is limited to 1GB. Adjust this parameter based on your system's RAM and the complexity of maintenance operations to ensure efficient resource utilization."}
