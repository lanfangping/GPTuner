{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_naptime' setting in PostgreSQL, adjust the minimum delay between autovacuum runs by modifying the postgresql.conf file or using the server command line. The default value is set to one minute (60 seconds), but it can be altered to suit the activity level of your database tables, allowing for less frequent vacuuming if necessary."}
