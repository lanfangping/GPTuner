{'suggestion': "The 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold' in PostgreSQL specifies when an automatic ANALYZE operation is triggered. By default, it is set to initiate after at least 50 tuples (rows) are inserted, updated, or deleted in a table. This setting can be adjusted via the postgresql.conf file or server command line and is also customizable at the table level through storage parameters."}
