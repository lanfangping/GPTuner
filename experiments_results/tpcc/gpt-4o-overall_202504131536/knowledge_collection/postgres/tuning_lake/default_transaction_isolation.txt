{'suggestion': 'To configure the \'default_transaction_isolation\' setting in PostgreSQL, set the default isolation level for new SQL transactions to \'read committed\'. This can be adjusted to other levels such as \'read uncommitted\', \'repeatable read\', or \'serializable\' if needed. You can specify the desired level by including "SET default_transaction_isolation = \'level\';" in your configuration file or session.'}
