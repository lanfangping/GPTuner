{'suggestion': "To effectively manage checkpoints in Postgres, configure the 'checkpoint_warning' knob to log a message if checkpoints caused by filled WAL segment files occur less frequently than every 30 seconds. This default setting indicates if there's a need to increase the 'max_wal_size'. Note that setting this to zero will disable the warning. Adjustments can only be made in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line, ensuring administrators are alerted to potential performance impacts due to frequent checkpoints."}
