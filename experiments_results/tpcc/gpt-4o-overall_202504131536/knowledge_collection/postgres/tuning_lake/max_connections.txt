{'suggestion': "To set the 'max_connections' value in PostgreSQL, it is crucial to consider both the system's available resources and the typical workload. This setting specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections allowed to the database server and typically defaults to 100. It must be configured at server start, ensuring that the value on a standby server matches or exceeds that of the master server to allow queries. For optimal performance, especially when using connection pooling, set this parameter as a low multiple (2-5x) of the number of cores on the server in transaction mode, or to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued in session mode. If not using connection pooling, set it to the required number of concurrent users. Adjust the number upwards if needed, ensuring the total memory usage remains within limits, such as not exceeding 70% of the server's total RAM when accounting for 'work_mem' and other settings."}
