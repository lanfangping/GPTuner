{'suggestion': "To configure the 'max_wal_senders' parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to a value that matches or exceeds the master server's setting to ensure replication functionality and the ability to run queries on standby servers. The default is 10 connections, but it should be adjusted to accommodate the maximum number of standby servers or streaming backup clients you plan to have, with additional capacity for future scalability if necessary. This ensures efficient management of concurrent connections from standby servers or streaming backup clients."}
