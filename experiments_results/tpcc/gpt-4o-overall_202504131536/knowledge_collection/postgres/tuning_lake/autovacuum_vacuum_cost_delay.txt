{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' parameter in PostgreSQL, set it in the postgresql.conf file or override it per table as needed. This parameter, which defaults to 2 milliseconds, specifies the delay in milliseconds for automatic VACUUM operations. If set to -1, it defaults to the 'vacuum_cost_delay' value. Adjust this parameter by decreasing the delay for more aggressive autovacuuming or increasing it to lessen the impact on concurrent query performance. Start with the default value and modify it according to your workload requirements to balance autovacuum performance with query performance."}
