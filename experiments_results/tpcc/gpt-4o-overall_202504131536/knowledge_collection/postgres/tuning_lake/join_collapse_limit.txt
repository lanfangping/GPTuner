{'suggestion': "For optimal performance in PostgreSQL, the 'join_collapse_limit' should be configured to balance planning time and query plan quality. Set it to a value that matches the 'from_collapse_limit' to ensure consistency. A setting of 1 can be used to preserve the specified JOIN order, while higher values may activate the GEQO planner, which could lead to suboptimal plans. Adjust the setting based on the complexity of your queries, considering lower values like 8 or 10 for simpler queries, and higher values for complex queries with many joins."}
