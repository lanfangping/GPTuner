{'suggestion': "To effectively configure the 'work_mem' setting in PostgreSQL, start by determining the base maximum memory used per query operation, such as sort or hash tables, before resorting to temporary disk usage. Consider allocating about 25% of the available memory for queries, adjusting based on query complexity and system workload. For OLTP queries that do not require complex joins or sorting large amounts of data, keep this value in the low MBs. For OLAP-style queries and fewer concurrent queries, it may grow into the GB range. Multiply by max_connections * N (where N is a small single-digit number) to estimate the maximum potential memory consumption by the Postgres process. Adjust as needed, potentially increasing the default value, which is often too small for modern systems. Christophe Pettus suggests starting with 16MB for most users. Additionally, consider the impact of 'hash_mem_multiplier' on hash operations, and adjust based on the performance and stability of your system."}
