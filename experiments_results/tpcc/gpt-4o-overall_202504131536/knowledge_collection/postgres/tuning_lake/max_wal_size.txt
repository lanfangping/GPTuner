{'suggestion': "Configure the 'max_wal_size' parameter in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line to set a soft limit on the WAL size during automatic checkpoints, starting with the default value of 1 GB. Adjust this value based on your workload requirements and available storage, especially under heavy load or when 'wal_keep_size' is high. Aim to prevent automatic checkpoints from being triggered by disk space constraints, thus allowing them to occur due to timeouts, which may increase recovery time after a database crash."}
