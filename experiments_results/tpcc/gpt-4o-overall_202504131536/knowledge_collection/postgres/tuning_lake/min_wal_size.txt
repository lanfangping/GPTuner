{'suggestion': "To configure the 'min_wal_size' parameter in PostgreSQL, it is essential to set this value in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line to ensure that old WAL files are recycled at checkpoints rather than removed, provided that WAL disk usage stays below this threshold. This setup helps maintain sufficient reserved space for potential spikes in usage. Unless there are significant disk space constraints, consider setting 'min_wal_size' to 1GB to optimize transaction log management while balancing disk utilization and recovery time."}
