{'suggestion': "To configure the 'max_worker_processes' knob in PostgreSQL, set it to a value that reflects the system's capability to support background processes, ensuring it is equal to or higher than the master server on a standby server to allow queries. Start with the system's default of 8, and consider adjusting based on the number of CPU cores available. For optimal performance, particularly in OLTP workloads, it is advisable to set the value between 75% to 90% of the CPU core count, especially for systems with a high core count, while ensuring it aligns with the system's performance requirements and workload type."}
