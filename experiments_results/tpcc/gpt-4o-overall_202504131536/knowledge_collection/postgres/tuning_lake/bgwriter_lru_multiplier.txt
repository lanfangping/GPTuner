{'suggestion': "To configure PostgreSQL's 'bgwriter_lru_multiplier', use the default value of 2.0, which helps manage how many dirty buffers are preemptively cleaned to handle demand spikes. This setting provides a buffer against sudden increases in demand, ensuring that no more than 'bgwriter_lru_maxpages' buffers are written per round. Adjust this value based on your system's workload: increase it if you experience frequent cache evictions or decrease it to conserve resources if write activity is minimal."}
