{'suggestion': "To configure the 'transaction_isolation' setting in PostgreSQL, it is initially set to align with 'default_transaction_isolation' at the beginning of each transaction. You can modify it during a transaction using the SQL command `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`, followed by one of the isolation levels: `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, or `SERIALIZABLE`. These levels offer increasing strictness in data consistency, with `READ COMMITTED` being the default."}
