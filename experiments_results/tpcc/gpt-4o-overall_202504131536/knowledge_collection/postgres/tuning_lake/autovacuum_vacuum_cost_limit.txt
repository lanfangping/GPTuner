{'suggestion': "To configure the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' in PostgreSQL, set it in the 'postgresql.conf' file or via the server command line. This parameter specifies the cost limit for automatic VACUUM operations, defaulting to -1 to use the regular 'vacuum_cost_limit' value. The limit is distributed among autovacuum workers to ensure it does not exceed the set value. For systems with higher I/O capacity, consider adjusting the value upwards from the default to allow more aggressive vacuuming, while monitoring system performance to avoid resource contention. Additionally, individual table settings can be specified using storage parameters."}
