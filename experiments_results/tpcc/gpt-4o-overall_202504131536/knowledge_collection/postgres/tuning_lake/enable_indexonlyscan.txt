{'suggestion': "To configure the 'enable_indexonlyscan' setting in PostgreSQL, ensure that the 'enable_indexscan' is also enabled, as both settings work in conjunction. The 'enable_indexonlyscan' knob, which defaults to 'on', allows the query planner to utilize index-only-scan plan types. You can adjust this setting using the SQL command `SET enable_indexonlyscan = {on|off}`, replacing `{on|off}` with your desired state. For permanent changes, this can also be specified in the `postgresql.conf` file."}
