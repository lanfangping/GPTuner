{"think_procedure": "The 'checkpoint_completion_target' knob in PostgreSQL is a parameter that specifies the fraction of time between checkpoints that PostgreSQL should spend writing dirty buffers to disk. It is a floating-point value between 0 and 1, where 0 means no time is spent writing dirty buffers and 1 means all the time is used. Values outside this range are not valid and do not represent special functions such as disabling a feature. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that cause the knob to perform a different function. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob within its valid range.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
