{"think_procedure": "The knob 'bgwriter_lru_multiplier' in PostgreSQL is a numerical knob. To determine if it is a 'special knob', we need to check if it has any special values that cause it to perform a different function than its regular operation. This knob controls the amount of effort the background writer puts into cleaning dirty pages in the buffer cache. Typically, it is a positive floating-point number that influences the behavior of the background writer. However, there are no documented special values like -1 or 0 that change its fundamental operation, such as disabling a feature or altering its behavior drastically. Therefore, 'bgwriter_lru_multiplier' does not have special values that break its natural order.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
