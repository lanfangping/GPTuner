{"think_procedure": "The 'transaction_isolation' knob in PostgreSQL is used to set the isolation level of transactions. It typically accepts string values such as 'read uncommitted', 'read committed', 'repeatable read', and 'serializable'. These values do not have a natural numerical order as they represent different isolation levels rather than numerical values. The knob does not have special numerical values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior significantly, such as disabling a feature or altering its function in a non-linear manner. Therefore, it does not fit the description of a 'special' numerical knob as described.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
