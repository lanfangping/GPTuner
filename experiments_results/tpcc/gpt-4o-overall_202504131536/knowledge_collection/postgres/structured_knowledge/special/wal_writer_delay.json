{"think_procedure": "First, I need to understand the purpose of the 'wal_writer_delay' knob in PostgreSQL. This knob controls the delay between WAL writer flushes, typically specified in milliseconds. Next, I should determine if there are any special values such as -1 or 0 that alter its behavior significantly, like disabling the feature or changing its operation mode. I will check the PostgreSQL documentation or reliable sources to verify if such special values exist for this knob. If a special value is found, I will classify it as a 'special knob'. Otherwise, it is a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
