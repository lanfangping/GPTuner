{"think_procedure": "The 'autovacuum' knob in PostgreSQL controls the autovacuum feature, which automatically cleans up and reclaims storage occupied by dead tuples. To determine if it's a special knob, we need to check if it has any special values that change its behavior significantly. In PostgreSQL, setting 'autovacuum' to 'off' (or false) completely disables the autovacuum feature. This is a special value because it alters the fundamental operation of the knob from managing autovacuum settings to disabling the feature entirely. Therefore, 'autovacuum' is a special knob because it has a specific value ('off') that changes its behavior from a regular numerical operation to a special function (disabling the feature).", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
