{"think_procedure": "First, understand what the 'wal_sync_method' knob in PostgreSQL does. This knob specifies the method used to ensure that WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) records are written to disk in a durable manner. It has several possible values like 'fsync', 'fdatasync', 'open_sync', 'open_datasync', etc. Next, determine if there are any special values, such as -1 or 0, that change the knob's behavior drastically compared to its regular ordered values. Check PostgreSQL documentation or relevant resources to see if setting it to a specific value like -1 or 0 disables the feature or changes its behavior significantly. Upon investigation, 'wal_sync_method' does not have such special values; it simply changes the method of syncing without any disabling feature. Therefore, it is not a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
