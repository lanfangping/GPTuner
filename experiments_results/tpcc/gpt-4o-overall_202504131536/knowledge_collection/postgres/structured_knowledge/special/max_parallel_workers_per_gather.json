{"think_procedure": "Firstly, identify the purpose of the 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' knob in PostgreSQL. This knob controls the maximum number of parallel worker processes that can be started by a single Gather or Gather Merge node during query execution. Next, determine if there are any special values that change the behavior of this knob. In PostgreSQL, a value of 0 is often used to disable parallelism, which is a significant deviation from its regular numerical operation where the knob sets the number of workers. Therefore, the value 0 is a special value for this knob. Assess whether this special value changes the knob's function entirely compared to its regular operation. Since setting it to 0 disables the feature, it indicates that this is a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
