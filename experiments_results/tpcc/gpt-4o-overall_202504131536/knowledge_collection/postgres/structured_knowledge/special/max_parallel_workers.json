{"think_procedure": "First, identify if the knob 'max_parallel_workers' has any special values that alter its behavior compared to its regular numerical range. Check the documentation or resources on PostgreSQL to determine if there are any values like -1 or 0 that disable the feature or change its function drastically. If such a value exists and changes the fundamental behavior of the knob, classify it as a 'special knob'. Otherwise, it is a regular numerical knob. For 'max_parallel_workers', investigate if values like -1 or 0 have a special meaning or if the value strictly follows a numerical order without special cases.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
