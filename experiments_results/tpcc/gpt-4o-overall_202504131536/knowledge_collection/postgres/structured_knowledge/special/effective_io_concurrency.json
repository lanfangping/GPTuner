{"think_procedure": "First, identify the purpose and typical behavior of the knob 'effective_io_concurrency' in PostgreSQL. This knob is used to configure the number of concurrent I/O operations that can be performed, typically having a natural order where higher values allow more concurrent operations. Next, check if there are any special values for this knob that alter its behavior significantly, such as disabling a feature or changing its operation mode. In the case of 'effective_io_concurrency', setting it to 0 is a special value that disables asynchronous I/O, which is a significant deviation from its regular functioning. Therefore, classify it as a special knob due to the presence of this special value.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
