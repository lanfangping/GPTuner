{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' is a special knob, we first need to understand its function and default behavior. This knob is used to set the cost limit for the autovacuum process in PostgreSQL. Normally, it is set to a positive integer which represents the cost limit for vacuum operations. However, if set to -1, it uses the default value specified by 'vacuum_cost_limit'. The presence of this -1 value indicates a different behavior (using a default setting instead of a specified limit), which is distinct from its regular numerical function. Therefore, it qualifies as a special numerical knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
