{"think_procedure": "The 'join_collapse_limit' knob in PostgreSQL is used to control the maximum number of tables that the planner will consider joining together in one step. By default, it has a numerical value that dictates the limit of tables for join optimization. However, if set to a special value of 1, it disables the join reordering process entirely, which is a distinct function compared to its regular operation. This indicates that 'join_collapse_limit' has a special value that breaks the natural order of its numerical settings.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 1}
