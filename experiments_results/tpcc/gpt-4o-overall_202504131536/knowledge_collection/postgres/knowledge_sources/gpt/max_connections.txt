To set the 'max_connections' value in PostgreSQL, consider the system's available resources and typical workload; a starting recommendation is to set it to 100 connections, but this can be adjusted upwards if needed, ensuring the total memory usage stays within limits, such as not exceeding 70% of the server's total RAM when accounting for work_mem and other settings.
