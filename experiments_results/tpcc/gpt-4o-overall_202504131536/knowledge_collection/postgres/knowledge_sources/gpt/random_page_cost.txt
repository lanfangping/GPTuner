To set the value of 'random_page_cost' in PostgreSQL, which defaults to 4.0, you should adjust it based on your storage type and performance testing: for example, reduce it to around 1.1 for SSDs to reflect their faster random access speeds, while traditional spinning disks might require a value closer to the default or slightly lower if performance permits.
