The "autovacuum_analyze_threshold" in PostgreSQL determines when to trigger an automatic ANALYZE operation, and it is typically set to a default of 50, meaning that the database will analyze tables after 50 row modifications plus an additional percentage of the total number of rows as specified by "autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor."
