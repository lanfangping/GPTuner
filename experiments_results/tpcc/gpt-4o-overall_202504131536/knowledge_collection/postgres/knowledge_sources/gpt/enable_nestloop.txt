To set the value for the 'enable_nestloop' knob in PostgreSQL, consider enabling it (TRUE) when the dataset is small or the query planner estimates a nested loop will be efficient, and disabling it (FALSE) for larger datasets where hash or merge joins are more efficient; assess performance through testing with representative queries and monitor execution costs, as there are no concrete numbers for direct comparison.
