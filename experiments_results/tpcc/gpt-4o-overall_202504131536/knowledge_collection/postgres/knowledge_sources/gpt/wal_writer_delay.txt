The `wal_writer_delay` in PostgreSQL, which determines the delay between each WAL write operation, can be adjusted to a lower value like 10ms for systems requiring frequent WAL writes to minimize data loss, or kept at the default of 200ms for reduced write overhead on less performance-critical systems.
