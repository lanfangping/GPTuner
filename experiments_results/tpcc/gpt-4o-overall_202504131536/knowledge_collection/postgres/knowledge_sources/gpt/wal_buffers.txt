To set the value for the 'wal_buffers' knob in PostgreSQL, it is generally recommended to start with the default setting which is typically 16MB for most systems, and then consider increasing it if you have a high transaction volume or large WAL usage; a good rule of thumb is to allocate around 3% of your shared_buffers, but not exceeding a maximum of 2048MB for most workloads, to optimize write-ahead logging performance.
