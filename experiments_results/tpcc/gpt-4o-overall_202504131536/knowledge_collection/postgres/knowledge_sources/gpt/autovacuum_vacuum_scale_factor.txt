To set the value for 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, start by using a typical default of 0.2, which means 20% of table rows need to change before an autovacuum is triggered, and adjust based on workload and table size; for large, frequently updated tables, consider reducing it to 0.05 or lower to ensure timely vacuum operations, while for smaller, less active tables, a higher setting might suffice.
