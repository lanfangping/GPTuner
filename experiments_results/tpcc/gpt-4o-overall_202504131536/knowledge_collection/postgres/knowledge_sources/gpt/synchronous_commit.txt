To set the value for the 'synchronous_commit' knob in PostgreSQL, consider the desired balance between performance and durability: set it to 'off' for maximum performance with potential risk of recent transaction loss during a crash, 'local' for minimizing commit wait times on the local server, 'remote_write' for ensuring commit waits only for WAL writes to remote servers, 'on' for full commit confirmation after both local and remote applies, or 'remote_apply' to ensure even higher durability at the cost of performance with all changes applied on remote systems before confirmation.
