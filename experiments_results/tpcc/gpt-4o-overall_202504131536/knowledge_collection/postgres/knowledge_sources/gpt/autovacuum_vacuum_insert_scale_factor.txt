To set the value for 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL, determine the proportion of insert-only tables that should trigger an autovacuum, typically starting with a default of 0.2 (20%) and adjusting based on table size and workload; consider lowering it to 0.05 (5%) for large insert-heavy tables to ensure more frequent maintenance.
