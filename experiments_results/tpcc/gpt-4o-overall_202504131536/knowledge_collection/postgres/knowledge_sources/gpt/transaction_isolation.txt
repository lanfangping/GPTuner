To set the value for the 'transaction_isolation' knob in PostgreSQL, use the SQL command `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` followed by one of the isolation levels: `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, or `SERIALIZABLE`, with each level offering increasing strictness in data consistency and potential impact on performance, where `READ COMMITTED` is the default and can be represented numerically as 1, and `SERIALIZABLE` as the strictest level at 4.
