The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' determines the number of inserted tuples needed to trigger a VACUUM on a table, with a default of 1000 tuples, and can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or server command line, though it can be adjusted for individual tables via storage parameters.
