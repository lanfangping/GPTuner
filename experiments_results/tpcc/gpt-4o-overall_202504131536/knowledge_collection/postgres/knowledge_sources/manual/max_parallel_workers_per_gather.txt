The "max_parallel_workers_per_gather" knob sets the maximum number of parallel workers a single Gather or Gather Merge node can initiate, with a default of 2, and setting it to 0 disables parallel queries; these queries can significantly increase resource utilization, potentially using up to 5 times more resources with 4 workers compared to a non-parallel query.
