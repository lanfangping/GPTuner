The 'autovacuum' knob controls the activation of the autovacuum launcher daemon, which is enabled by default, requires 'track_counts' to be active, and its setting can only be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line, though it can be disabled on individual tables through storage parameters; even if disabled, autovacuum processes may still run to prevent transaction ID wraparound.
