The 'checkpoint_warning' knob logs a message if checkpoints caused by filled WAL segment files occur less than every 30 seconds by default, indicating a need to raise max_wal_size, with zero disabling the warning; this setting is only adjustable in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line.
