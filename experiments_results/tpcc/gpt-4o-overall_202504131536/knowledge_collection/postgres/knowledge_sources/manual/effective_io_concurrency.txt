The 'effective_io_concurrency' knob in PostgreSQL sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations, with a valid range of 0 to 1000, where 0 disables asynchronous I/O, and is primarily impactful for bitmap heap scans, suggesting values based on storage type, such as lower settings for magnetic drives and potentially hundreds for SSDs, while considering that asynchronous I/O requires an operational 'posix_fadvise' function.
