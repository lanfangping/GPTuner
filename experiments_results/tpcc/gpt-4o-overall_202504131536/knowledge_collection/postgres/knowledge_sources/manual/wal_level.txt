The `wal_level` parameter determines the extent of information logged to the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) in PostgreSQL, with options including `minimal` (logging only crash recovery data), `replica` (enabling WAL archiving and replication), and `logical` (supporting logical decoding), with each level encompassing all information from lower levels; note that this setting, adjustable only at server start, affects performance and data recovery capabilities, where `minimal` results in the least WAL volume and `logical` potentially increases it when handling many UPDATE and DELETE operations.
