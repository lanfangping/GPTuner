The 'wal_buffers' parameter determines the amount of shared memory allocated for WAL data not yet written to disk, defaulting to 1/32nd (about 3%) of shared_buffers but not less than 64kB or more than 16MB, with manual settings under 32kB treated as 32kB, requiring configuration at server start for optimal performance in busy environments.
