The `synchronous_commit` setting determines the extent of WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) completion required before the database server acknowledges a "success" to the client, offering various levels from `off`, where there can be a delay up to three times `wal_writer_delay` with no risk of inconsistency but potential data loss on crash, to `remote_apply`, where commits pause until they are applied and visible on synchronous standbys, causing larger delays for enhanced durability.
