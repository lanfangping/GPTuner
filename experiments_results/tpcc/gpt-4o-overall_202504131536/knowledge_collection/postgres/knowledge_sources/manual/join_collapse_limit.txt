The `join_collapse_limit` setting controls the number of JOINs the planner will rewrite into a list of FROM items, with its default value matching `from_collapse_limit` to balance planning time and query plan quality, and setting it to 1 ensures the specified JOIN order is preserved, while values equal to or exceeding `geqo_threshold` may activate the GEQO planner, potentially leading to suboptimal plans.
