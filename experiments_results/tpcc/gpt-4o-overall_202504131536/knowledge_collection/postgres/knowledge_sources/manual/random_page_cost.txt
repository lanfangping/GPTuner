The 'random_page_cost' knob sets the planner's estimated cost of fetching a non-sequential disk page, with a default value of 4.0, used to represent random access as 40 times slower than sequential but assuming 90% of random reads are cached, and can be adjusted based on actual caching conditions, such as increasing it beyond 4.0 if less cached or decreasing it closer to 1.1 for solid-state drives with lower random read costs.
