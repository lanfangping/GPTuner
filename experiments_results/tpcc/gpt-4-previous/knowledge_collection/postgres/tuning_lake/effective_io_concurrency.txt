### Comprehensive Suggestion:

The `effective_io_concurrency` knob in PostgreSQL should be configured based on the type of storage used, the database workload, and the operating system's support for the `posix_fadvise` function. This setting determines the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that can be executed simultaneously, which is particularly relevant for bitmap heap scans. Optimizing this value is crucial for achieving efficient I/O performance in PostgreSQL.
