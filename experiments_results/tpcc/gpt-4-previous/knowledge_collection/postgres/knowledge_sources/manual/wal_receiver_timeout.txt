The 'wal_receiver_timeout' knob terminates replication connections that are inactive for more than the specified time, defaulting to 60 seconds, to help the receiving standby server detect a primary node crash or network outage, with a value of zero disabling the timeout, and it can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.
