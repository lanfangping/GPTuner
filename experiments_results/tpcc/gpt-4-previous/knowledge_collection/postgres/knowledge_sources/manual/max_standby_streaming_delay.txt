The 'max_standby_streaming_delay' knob in Hot Standby determines the maximum duration the standby server will wait before cancelling standby queries conflicting with incoming WAL entries, specifically when WAL data is received via streaming replication. The default value is 30 seconds, but it can be set to wait indefinitely by using -1. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.
