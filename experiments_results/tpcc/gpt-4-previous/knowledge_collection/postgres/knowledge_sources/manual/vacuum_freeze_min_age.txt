The 'vacuum_freeze_min_age' knob specifies the cutoff age for VACUUM to decide when to freeze row versions in a table, with a default of 50 million transactions and a range of zero to one billion, but it's effectively limited to half the value of autovacuum_freeze_max_age to prevent unreasonably short intervals between forced autovacuums.
