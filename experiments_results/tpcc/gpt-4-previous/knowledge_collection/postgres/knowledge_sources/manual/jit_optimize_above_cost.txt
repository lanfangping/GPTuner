The 'jit_optimize_above_cost' knob sets the query cost threshold, defaulting at 500000, above which expensive JIT compilation optimizations are applied, potentially increasing planning time but improving execution speed, with settings less than 'jit_above_cost' being meaningless and more than 'jit_inline_above_cost' likely unbeneficial, and a setting of -1 disabling these optimizations.
