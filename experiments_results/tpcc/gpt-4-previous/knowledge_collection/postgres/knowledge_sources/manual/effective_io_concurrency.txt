The 'effective_io_concurrency' knob in PostgreSQL sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that can be executed simultaneously, with an allowed range of 1 to 1000, or zero to disable asynchronous I/O requests, primarily affecting bitmap heap scans, and its optimal value depends on the type of storage used, the database workload, and the operating system's support for the posix_fadvise function.
