To set the `enable_indexscan` knob in PostgreSQL, set it to `on` (enabled) for scenarios where index scans are beneficial, typically when the query selects less than 10-20% of the total rows, and to `off` (disabled) when the query selects a larger portion of the data, as full scans may be more efficient.
