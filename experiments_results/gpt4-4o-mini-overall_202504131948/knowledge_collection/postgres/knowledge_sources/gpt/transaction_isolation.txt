To set the 'transaction_isolation' level in PostgreSQL, you can configure it to one of four options: 'read uncommitted' (the default, 0), 'read committed' (the most commonly used, 1), 'repeatable read' (2), or 'serializable' (3) by executing the SQL command `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL <level>;` where `<level>` is one of the aforementioned options based on your applicationâ€™s concurrency and consistency requirements.
