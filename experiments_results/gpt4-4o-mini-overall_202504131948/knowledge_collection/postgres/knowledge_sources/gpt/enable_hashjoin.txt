To optimize the 'enable_hashjoin' knob in PostgreSQL, set it to 'on' (true) to activate hash joins, which is generally beneficial for queries with large datasets; if experimenting with specific workloads, it may be helpful to start with a base configuration and adjust the 'work_mem' setting to at least 4MB or higher, depending on your available memory resources.
