To set the `max_wal_size` parameter in PostgreSQL, you can configure it to a value based on your systemâ€™s workload and available disk space; a common recommendation is to set it between 1 GB to 4 GB (e.g., `max_wal_size = '2GB'`) for moderate workloads, ensuring that it does not exceed 25% of your total disk space dedicated to PostgreSQL.
