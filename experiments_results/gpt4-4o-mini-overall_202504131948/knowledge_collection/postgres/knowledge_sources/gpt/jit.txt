To set the 'jit' (Just-In-Time compilation) parameter in PostgreSQL, you can adjust its value by using the command `SET jit TO ON;` to enable it or `SET jit TO OFF;` to disable it, with a default value of "on" for newer versions, and it is generally recommended to leave it enabled unless you experience specific performance issues, particularly in complex queries or with certain workloads.
