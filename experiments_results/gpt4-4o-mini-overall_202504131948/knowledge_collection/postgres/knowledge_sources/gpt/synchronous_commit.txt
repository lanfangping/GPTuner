To optimize the performance of your PostgreSQL database, set the `synchronous_commit` parameter to 'off' for lower latency in applications where data loss can be tolerated, or to 'on' for maximum durability, with 'remote_write' (for asynchronous replication) as a middle ground, depending on your desired balance between performance (0 for 'off', 1 for 'remote_write', and 2 for 'on') and data safety.
