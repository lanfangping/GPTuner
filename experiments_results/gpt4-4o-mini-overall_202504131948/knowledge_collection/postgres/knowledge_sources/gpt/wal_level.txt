To set the 'wal_level' parameter in PostgreSQL, you should use 'minimal' for basic replication needs, 'replica' for standard streaming replication, or 'logical' for supporting logical replication; typically, 'replica' is set for most production environments, and you can adjust this in the `postgresql.conf` file or by using the command `ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'replica';`, followed by a server restart.
