To set the `wal_compression` parameter in PostgreSQL, configure it to `on` to enable compression for WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) files, which is particularly beneficial for systems with high write loads; if using compression, ensure that your system has adequate CPU resources, as compression may increase CPU usage, especially in environments where WAL generation exceeds 1 GB per minute.
