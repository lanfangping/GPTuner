To set the `force_parallel_mode` knob in PostgreSQL, you can configure its value to either `off`, `on`, or `regression`, with the default being `off`; for optimal performance, it's typically recommended to use `on` if your queries can benefit from parallelism, ensuring that your system has sufficient available resources and that you monitor the impact on performance metrics.
