To optimize the 'full_page_writes' setting in PostgreSQL, you should set it to 'on' for systems that use frequent write operations or where data integrity is crucial, particularly if you are using WAL (Write Ahead Logging) and your database is not on a battery-backed RAID; otherwise, leave it 'off' to improve performance, while monitoring the impact on your specific workload and considering setups with sufficient backups or replicas.
