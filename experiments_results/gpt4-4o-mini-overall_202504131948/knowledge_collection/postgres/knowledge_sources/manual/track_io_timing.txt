The 'track_io_timing' knob, which is disabled by default due to potential significant overhead from frequent time queries, allows for timing of database I/O calls and can be monitored via pg_stat_database, EXPLAIN with BUFFERS, and pg_stat_statements, with changes permitted only by superusers; users can assess overhead using the pg_test_timing tool.
