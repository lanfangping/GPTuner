The 'effective_io_concurrency' knob in PostgreSQL, which ranges from 0 to 1000 (defaulting to 1), controls the number of concurrent disk I/O operations expected, with recommended settings for magnetic drives based on the number of disks in a RAID setup (not counting parity drives), while SSDs may benefit from values in the hundreds, acknowledging the potential for CPU overhead with excessively high settings.
