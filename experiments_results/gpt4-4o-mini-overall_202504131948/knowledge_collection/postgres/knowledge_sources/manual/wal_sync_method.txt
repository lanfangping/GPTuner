The 'wal_sync_method' knob specifies how write-ahead log (WAL) updates are flushed to disk, with options including 'open_datasync', 'fdatasync' (default on Linux and FreeBSD), 'fsync', 'fsync_writethrough', and 'open_sync', where the chosen method depends on platform compatibility and may require adjustments for crash safety and performance optimization.
