The 'full_page_writes' knob in PostgreSQL, which is enabled by default, ensures that the entire disk page content is written to the Write Ahead Log (WAL) during the first modification after a checkpoint to prevent data corruption during crashes, but this increases WAL data size, and its disabling may risk unrecoverable data loss, akin to the risks of turning off fsync.
