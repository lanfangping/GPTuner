The 'max_wal_senders' parameter specifies the maximum number of concurrent WAL sender connections, defaulting to 10, with a value of 0 disabling replication; it should be set slightly higher than the expected client connections and must be equal to or greater than the value set on the master server when running a standby server, while requiring 'wal_level' to be at least 'replica' for connections to be allowed.
