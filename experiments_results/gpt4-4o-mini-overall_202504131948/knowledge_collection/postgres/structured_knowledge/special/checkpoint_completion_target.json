{"think_procedure": "The knob 'checkpoint_completion_target' in PostgreSQL is used to control the target duration for checkpoint completion. It is a numerical value that represents the fraction of the checkpoint interval that the system will aim to use for writing dirty buffers to disk. The value typically ranges from 0 to 1. Special values like -1 or 0 are not applicable to this knob as it does not have any special behavior associated with such values. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob without any special conditions.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
