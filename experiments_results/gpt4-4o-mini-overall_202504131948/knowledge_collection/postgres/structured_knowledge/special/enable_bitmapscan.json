Note that 'enable_bitmapscan' is typically set to true or false, where true enables bitmap scans and false disables them. 4. Check if there are any special values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a different function. 5. Conclude that since the knob does not have special values that break the natural order, it is not classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
