{"think_procedure": "The knob 'track_commit_timestamp' in PostgreSQL controls whether the database tracks the commit timestamps for transactions. This knob can take a boolean value (on or off), and it is not typically associated with special values like -1 or 0 that would change its fundamental operation. Therefore, it does not fit the definition of a 'special knob' as described.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
