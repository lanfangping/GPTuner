Understand the purpose of the 'transaction_isolation' setting in PostgreSQL, which determines the isolation level for transactions. 3. Check if it has any special values that alter its usual functionality. 4. The typical values for this knob are 'read uncommitted', 'read committed', 'repeatable read', and 'serializable'.
