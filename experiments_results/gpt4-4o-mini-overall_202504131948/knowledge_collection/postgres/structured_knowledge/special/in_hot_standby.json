{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the purpose of the 'in_hot_standby' knob in PostgreSQL. 2. Determine if it has a natural order of numerical values. 3. Check if it has any special values like -1 or 0 that alter its function significantly. 4. Since 'in_hot_standby' is used to control whether a standby server can accept read-only queries, assess if setting it to a specific value disables this feature or changes its behavior. 5. Conclude that it does have a special function when set to 'off' (0) or 'on' (1), but does not have special values like -1. 6. Therefore, classify it as a regular knob rather than a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
