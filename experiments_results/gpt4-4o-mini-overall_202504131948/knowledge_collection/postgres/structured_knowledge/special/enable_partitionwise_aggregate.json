{"think_procedure": "First, I need to understand the purpose of the 'enable_partitionwise_aggregate' knob in PostgreSQL. This knob is related to query optimization, specifically for partitioned tables. It allows the database to perform aggregate functions on partitions individually before combining the results. Next, I consider if this knob has any special values, such as -1 or 0, that would indicate a different behavior. In the case of 'enable_partitionwise_aggregate', it is typically a boolean setting where 'on' or 'off' determines its function. Since there are no special values like -1 or 0 that change its fundamental behavior, I conclude that this knob does not qualify as a special knob. Therefore, the classification is that it is not a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
