{"think_procedure": "The knob 'work_mem' in PostgreSQL is used to set the amount of memory to be used by internal sort operations and hash tables before writing to temporary disk files. It is a numerical value that can be adjusted to optimize performance based on workload. However, it does not have any special values like -1 or 0 that would change its function fundamentally. Therefore, it follows a natural order and does not break that order with special cases.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
