Check the documentation to see if setting 'jit' to a specific value (like -1 or 0) disables or changes its behavior. 4. Conclude if 'jit' behaves differently when set to these special values compared to its normal numerical range. 5. Based on findings, classify 'jit' as a special knob or not.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
