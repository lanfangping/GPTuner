{"think_procedure": "The knob 'statement_timeout' in PostgreSQL is used to set the maximum allowed duration for a statement to run before being automatically terminated. The value can be set to a positive integer representing milliseconds, but it can also be set to special values like 0 or -1. Setting it to 0 means that there is no timeout, and setting it to -1 means that the timeout is disabled. Therefore, it has special values that alter its normal behavior, indicating that it can be classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": [0, -1]}
