{"think_procedure": "The knob 'checkpoint_timeout' in PostgreSQL determines the maximum time between automatic WAL (Write Ahead Log) checkpoints. It is a numerical setting that can be adjusted to optimize performance. It does not have special values like -1 or 0 that would change its fundamental operation or disable a feature. Therefore, it follows a natural order of numerical values, and there are no special functions associated with specific values. Hence, it is not classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
