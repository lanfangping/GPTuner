{'suggestion': "To optimally configure the 'autovacuum_max_workers' parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to a value based on your database size and the total number of CPU cores available on the server. For smaller databases (up to ~10GB), use 2-3 workers; for medium databases (10GB to 100GB), use 4-5 workers; and for larger databases (over 100GB), use 6-10 workers. Note that this parameter determines the maximum number of concurrent autovacuum processes (excluding the autovacuum launcher) and can only be adjusted during server startup, with a default setting of three."}
