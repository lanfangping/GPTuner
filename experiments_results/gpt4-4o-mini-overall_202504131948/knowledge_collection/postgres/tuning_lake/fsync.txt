{'suggestion': "To ensure data durability and integrity in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to keep the 'fsync' setting enabled. This setting invokes fsync() calls to physically write updates to disk, which is crucial for data recovery after crashes. While disabling 'fsync' can improve performance, it poses a significant risk of unrecoverable data corruption, particularly in noncritical transactions. Therefore, maintaining 'fsync' as 'on' is essential for preventing data loss."}
