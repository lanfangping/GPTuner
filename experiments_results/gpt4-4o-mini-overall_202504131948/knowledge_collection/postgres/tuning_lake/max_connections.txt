{'suggestion': "To configure the `max_connections` parameter in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 100 connections, ensuring it is set equal to or higher on standby servers compared to the master. If using connection pooling, set `max_connections` to a low multiple (2-5x) of the server's core count, or to the minimum number of concurrent users for session mode. If not using connection pooling, adjust the value based on the required number of concurrent users. Additionally, consider the server's available RAM, generally allocating about 10 MB of RAM per connection, and monitor performance to make further adjustments as necessary."}
