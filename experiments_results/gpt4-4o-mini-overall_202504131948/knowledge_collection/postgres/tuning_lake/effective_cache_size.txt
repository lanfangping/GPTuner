{'suggestion': "Configure the `effective_cache_size` in PostgreSQL to estimate the disk cache available for a single query, which influences the planner's choices. A recommended setting is approximately 50-75% of your system's total RAM; for example, if your server has 16 GB of RAM, set it between 8 GB and 12 GB. Alternatively, you can calculate it using the formula: system RAM - (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) * 1.1, or choose a lower value if the server is not exclusively dedicated to PostgreSQL."}
