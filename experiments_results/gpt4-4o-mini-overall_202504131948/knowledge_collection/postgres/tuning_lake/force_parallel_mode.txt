{'suggestion': "To configure the `force_parallel_mode` knob in PostgreSQL, set its value to 'off', 'on', or 'regress', with 'off' as the default. Use 'off' to allow parallel queries only when performance improvements are expected, 'on' to enforce parallel execution for safe queries (adding a Gather node to the query plan), or 'regress' to enable forced parallelism while suppressing parallel worker context messages and hiding Gather nodes in EXPLAIN output for regression testing. For optimal performance, it is recommended to use 'on' if your queries can benefit from parallelism, ensuring that your system has sufficient resources and monitoring the impact on performance metrics."}
