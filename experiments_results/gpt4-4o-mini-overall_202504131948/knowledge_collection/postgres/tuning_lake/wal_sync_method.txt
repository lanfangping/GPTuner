{'suggestion': "To configure the `wal_sync_method` in PostgreSQL, set it to one of the available options such as 'open_datasync', 'fdatasync' (default on Linux and FreeBSD), 'fsync', or 'open_sync'. The choice of method should be based on platform compatibility and may require adjustments to optimize for crash safety and performance. For standard durability, 'fsync' is recommended, while 'fdatasync' offers a balance between performance and durability. It is advisable to consult PostgreSQL's documentation for specific recommendations tailored to your workload and environment."}
