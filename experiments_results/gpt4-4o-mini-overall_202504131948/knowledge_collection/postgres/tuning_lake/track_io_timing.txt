{'suggestion': 'To enable the `track_io_timing` feature in PostgreSQL, set its value to `on`, allowing for the tracking of I/O timings to diagnose performance issues. This feature is disabled by default due to potential overhead from frequent time queries, so it is important to monitor your workload and assess any performance impact using tools like pg_test_timing. Changes to this setting can only be made by superusers, and the timing information can be accessed through pg_stat_database, EXPLAIN with BUFFERS, and pg_stat_statements.'}
