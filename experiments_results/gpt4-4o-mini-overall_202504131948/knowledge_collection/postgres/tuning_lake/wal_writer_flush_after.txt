{'suggestion': 'To optimize performance in PostgreSQL, set the `wal_writer_flush_after` parameter to a value of 1 (8kB), which determines the frequency of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) flushing based on volume. The default is 1MB, and setting it to 0 will prompt immediate flushing. Adjust this value based on your specific workload characteristics and hardware capabilities to balance write performance and data safety.'}
