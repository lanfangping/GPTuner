{'suggestion': "To configure the 'track_activities' knob in PostgreSQL, it is enabled by default and collects data on the currently executing command and its start time for each session. This information is viewable only to superusers and those with specific privileges, and only superusers can modify this setting. For most production environments, it is advisable to keep this setting enabled for effective monitoring and performance analysis."}
