{'suggestion': "To optimize query performance in PostgreSQL, ensure that the 'enable_bitmapscan' configuration parameter is set to 'on', which is enabled by default. This parameter allows the query planner to utilize bitmap-scan plan types, potentially improving performance for specific queries. You can enable it by executing the SQL command `SET enable_bitmapscan = ON;` or by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file to include `enable_bitmapscan = on`."}
