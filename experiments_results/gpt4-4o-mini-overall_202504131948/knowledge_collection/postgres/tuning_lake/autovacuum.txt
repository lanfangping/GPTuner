{'suggestion': "To effectively manage the PostgreSQL autovacuum feature, ensure that the 'autovacuum' knob is enabled by default and configured in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. Note that it requires 'track_counts' to be activated. Even if autovacuum is disabled, it will still run processes for transaction ID wraparound prevention, as outlined in Section 24.1.5."}
