{'suggestion': "For the `default_statistics_target` knob in PostgreSQL, set its value based on the complexity of your queries and the size of your data. Larger values can enhance the planner's estimates for table columns without a specific target, leading to more accurate execution plans, especially in large systems. However, this comes at the cost of increased planning time and storage overhead, so it's essential to understand the effects of raising this value. Medium-sized systems typically perform well with values around 200, while larger systems may require significantly higher values."}
