{'suggestion': "To configure the 'wal_level' parameter in PostgreSQL, you should set it to 'replica' for standard streaming replication and WAL archiving, as this is the default and recommended setting for most production environments. The possible settings include 'minimal' for the least logging, which is suitable for basic needs, and 'logical' for enhanced logging that supports logical decoding, but this can lead to increased WAL volume, especially with frequent updates on REPLICA IDENTITY FULL tables. You can adjust this parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file or by using the command `ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'replica';`, followed by a server restart."}
