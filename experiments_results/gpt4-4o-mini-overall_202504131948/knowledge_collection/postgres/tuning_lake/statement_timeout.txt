{'suggestion': "To set the `statement_timeout` in PostgreSQL, use the command `SET statement_timeout = '5000ms';` to specify a timeout duration of 5 seconds. This setting aborts any statement that runs longer than the specified duration, applying individually to each SQL statement within a single message, starting from when the command is received until it completes. Additionally, if the logging level is set to ERROR or lower, the timeout can be logged."}
