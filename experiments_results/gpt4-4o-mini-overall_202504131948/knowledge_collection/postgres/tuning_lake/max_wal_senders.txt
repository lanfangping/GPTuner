{'suggestion': "To configure the `max_wal_senders` parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to a value slightly higher than the maximum number of concurrent replication connections you expect, typically starting with a range of 2 to 5 for small to medium-sized systems, while ensuring that it aligns with the maximum number of replicas anticipated in the cluster. The default value is 10, and setting it to 0 disables replication. Additionally, ensure that 'wal_level' is set to at least 'replica' to allow connections."}
