The 'archive_mode' knob, when enabled, sends completed WAL segments to archive storage by setting the 'archive_command', with two modes available: 'on' and 'always', the latter of which enables the WAL archiver during archive recovery or standby mode, archiving all files restored from the archive or streamed with streaming replication. This parameter can only be set at server start and cannot be enabled when 'wal_level' is set to minimal.
