**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

Set the `effective_cache_size` to a value that reflects the planner's assumption about the size of the disk cache available to a single query, considering both PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel's disk cache for PostgreSQL data files. This setting should be approximately 50-70% of the total available RAM, typically around 40-60 GB for systems with 64 GB of RAM, to optimize PostgreSQL's use of the operating system cache. This configuration influences the use of index or sequential scans without affecting the size of shared memory allocated by PostgreSQL or reserving kernel disk cache. If the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL, consider setting a lower value based on the formula: system RAM - (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) * 1.1.
