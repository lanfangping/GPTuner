The 'checkpoint_flush_after' knob in PostgreSQL attempts to force the OS to issue writes to the storage when more than a specified amount of data has been written during a checkpoint, which can reduce transaction latency but may degrade performance in some cases. The value is measured in blocks (typically 8kB), with a valid range of 0 (disabling forced writeback) to 2MB, and a default of 256kB on Linux and 0 elsewhere.
