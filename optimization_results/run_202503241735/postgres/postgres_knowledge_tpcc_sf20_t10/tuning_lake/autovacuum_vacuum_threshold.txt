### Comprehensive Suggestion:

Adjust the `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` setting to a value that balances between preventing excessive vacuuming (e.g., 50-100) and ensuring timely cleanup of dead tuples (e.g., 250-500), considering the table's update/delete activity and the system's I/O capacity. This setting triggers a VACUUM in a table when the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples reaches a certain threshold, which can be adjusted in the `postgresql.conf` file or via the server command line. Additionally, it can be customized for individual tables by altering table storage parameters.
