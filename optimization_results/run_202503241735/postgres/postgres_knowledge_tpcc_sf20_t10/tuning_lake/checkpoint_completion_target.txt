**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

The 'checkpoint_completion_target' knob in PostgreSQL is used to set the goal for checkpoint completion as a percentage of the total time between checkpoints. This setting can only be adjusted in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line. To optimize performance, it is recommended to raise this value to smooth I/O activity of checkpoints over larger periods of time. However, if this value is relied upon for feeding non-streaming replicas, it should be kept within a low percentage to maintain consistency. On development instances, it is advisable to set this value to a level that balances performance and consistency.
