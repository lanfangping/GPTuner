The 'cursor_tuple_fraction' knob adjusts the planner's estimate of the fraction of a cursor's rows that will be retrieved, with the default set at 0.1, and it influences the speed at which the first few rows are retrieved and the total estimated time it takes to fetch all rows, with a maximum setting of 1.0 treating cursors like regular queries.
