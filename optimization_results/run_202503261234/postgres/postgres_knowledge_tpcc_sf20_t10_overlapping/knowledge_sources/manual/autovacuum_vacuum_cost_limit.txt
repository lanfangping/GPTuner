The 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' knob sets the cost limit for automatic VACUUM operations in PostgreSQL, with a default value of -1, which uses the regular vacuum_cost_limit value, and this value is proportionally distributed among multiple running autovacuum workers to ensure their combined limits do not exceed this variable's value; it can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or server command line, but can be overridden for specific tables by altering table storage parameters.
