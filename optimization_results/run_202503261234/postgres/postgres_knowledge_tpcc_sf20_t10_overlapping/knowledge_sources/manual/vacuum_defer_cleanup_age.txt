The 'vacuum_defer_cleanup_age' knob specifies the number of transactions that VACUUM and HOT updates will delay cleanup of dead row versions, with the default being zero transactions, allowing for immediate removal of dead row versions; this value may be increased to allow more time for queries on standby servers to complete, but the exact amount of additional time is unpredictable as it depends on the number of write transactions on the primary server.
