**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

The 'autovacuum' knob in PostgreSQL controls the activation of the autovacuum launcher daemon, which is enabled by default and requires 'track_counts' to be enabled for it to function. This setting can be configured in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line, and it can also be disabled for individual tables if needed. To optimize performance, start with the default values `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.2` and `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 50`, then fine-tune these parameters based on the system's workload and observed database activity.
