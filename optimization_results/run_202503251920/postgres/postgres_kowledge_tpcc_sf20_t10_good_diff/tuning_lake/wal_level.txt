**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

The `wal_level` configuration parameter in PostgreSQL determines the amount of information written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL). The default value supports WAL archiving and replication, ensuring that only the necessary information for crash recovery is logged. Additionally, higher levels like logical decoding can be set to include more detailed information, but this must be done at server start, as the `wal_level` can only be configured during initialization. Each higher level includes all the information logged at lower levels, providing a comprehensive and layered approach to WAL management.
