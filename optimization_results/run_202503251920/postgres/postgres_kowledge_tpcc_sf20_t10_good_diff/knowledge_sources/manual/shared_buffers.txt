The 'shared_buffers' knob sets the memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers, typically defaulting to 128MB, but can be set to a minimum of 128KB or higher for better performance. For servers with 1GB or more RAM, it's reasonable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of system memory, but not more than 40%, while systems with less than 1GB RAM should use a smaller percentage.
