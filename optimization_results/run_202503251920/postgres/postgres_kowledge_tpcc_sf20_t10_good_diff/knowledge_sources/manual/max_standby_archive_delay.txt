The 'max_standby_archive_delay' knob in Hot Standby determines the duration the standby server waits before cancelling standby queries conflicting with upcoming WAL entries, specifically when WAL data is read from WAL archive; it is measured in milliseconds, defaults to 30 seconds, and can be set to -1 for indefinite waiting, but it only applies to the total time allowed for any one WAL segment's data application, not individual query run time.
