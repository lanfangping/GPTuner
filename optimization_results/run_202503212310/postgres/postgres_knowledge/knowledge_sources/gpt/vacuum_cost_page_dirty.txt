To set the `vacuum_cost_page_dirty` parameter in PostgreSQL, a common recommendation is to start with a value of **20** to **100**, adjusting based on the specific workload and performance observations, where lower values may be suitable for systems with a high transaction load and higher values can be used for systems that can tolerate more aggressive vacuuming.
