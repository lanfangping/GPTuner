To set the 'max_connections' parameter in PostgreSQL, determine the number of expected concurrent connections and set it to a value that accommodates them, typically starting with the formula of `(number of expected users x 1.5) + 10`, with a common default of 100 connections, but adjust based on your system's available resources and workload.
