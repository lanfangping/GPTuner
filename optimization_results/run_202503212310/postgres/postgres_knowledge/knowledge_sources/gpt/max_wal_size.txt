To set the `max_wal_size` parameter in PostgreSQL, you should typically configure it to a size between 1GB to 4GB, with the default being 1GB, adjusting based on your workload and available storage, for example, increasing it to 2GB or 4GB if your system experiences frequent checkpointing and needs more write-ahead log space.
