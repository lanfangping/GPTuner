Set the `wal_keep_size` parameter in PostgreSQL to a value that ensures sufficient Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) are retained for your replication needs, typically between 1 GB and 10 GB, depending on your replication delay and the expected load, ensuring it does not exceed the total disk space available for WAL files.
