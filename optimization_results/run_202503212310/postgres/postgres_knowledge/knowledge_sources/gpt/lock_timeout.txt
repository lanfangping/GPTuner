To set the `lock_timeout` value in PostgreSQL, adjust it to a suitable duration such as `100ms` to `5000ms` (5 seconds) based on your application's tolerance for waiting on locks, using the command `SET lock_timeout = '500ms';` for an immediate session change, or by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file for a server-wide configuration.
