To set the `vacuum_freeze_table_age` in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to use a value that typically ranges between 150 million and 200 million transactions (or approximately 200,000,000), which helps to optimize the balance between preventing transaction ID wraparound and minimizing vacuums, ensuring a healthy database performance without excessive locking.
