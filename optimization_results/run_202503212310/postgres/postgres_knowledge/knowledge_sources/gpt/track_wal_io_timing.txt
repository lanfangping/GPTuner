To set the `track_wal_io_timing` parameter in PostgreSQL, you should set its value to `on` to enable tracking of WAL I/O timing, but keep in mind that enabling this feature may introduce slight overhead, so it's recommended for debugging or performance tuning, particularly when using specific workload scenario tests.
