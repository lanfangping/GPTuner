To set the `track_io_timing` knob in PostgreSQL, you should enable it by setting the value to `on`, which allows the collection of I/O timing statisticsâ€”this can be done by adding `track_io_timing = on` in the `postgresql.conf` file and then restarting the PostgreSQL server for the changes to take effect.
