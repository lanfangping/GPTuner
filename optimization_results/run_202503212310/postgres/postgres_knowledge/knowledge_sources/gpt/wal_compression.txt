To set the `wal_compression` parameter in PostgreSQL, adjust its value to `on` to enable WAL (Write Ahead Log) compression, which is particularly beneficial for high-write workloads, while ensuring that your system can handle the increased CPU overhead; typically, it is recommended to monitor write loads before enabling and to consider settings like `shared_buffers` at about 25% of total RAM and `work_mem` set between `4MB` and `16MB` based on workload requirements for optimal performance.
