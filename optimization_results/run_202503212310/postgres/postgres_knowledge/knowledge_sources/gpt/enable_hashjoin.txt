To optimize the use of the `enable_hashjoin` knob in PostgreSQL, set its value to `on` to allow hash join operations for queries, as this is the default setting, but you may monitor performance and consider explicitly setting it to `off` if you notice performance degradation in scenarios where hash joins are not preferable, typically in systems with limited memory (e.g., less than 4 GB of RAM) or very small datasets.
