To set the `checkpoint_segments` parameter in PostgreSQL, you can configure it to a value between 3 and 64 segments based on your workload, with a recommended starting point of 32 segments for moderate to high write loads, as it controls the maximum number of write-ahead log (WAL) segments that can be filled before a checkpoint occurs.
