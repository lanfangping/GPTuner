To enable the `enable_indexonlyscan` option in PostgreSQL, set its value to `on` in the `postgresql.conf` file or through a session-level command by executing `SET enable_indexonlyscan = on;`, which allows the database to utilize index-only scans, potentially improving query performance when the index contains all the necessary columns for the query.
