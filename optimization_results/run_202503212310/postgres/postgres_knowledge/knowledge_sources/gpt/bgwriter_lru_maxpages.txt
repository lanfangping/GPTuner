To optimize the `bgwriter_lru_maxpages` parameter in PostgreSQL, set its value based on the workload and available memory, typically between 100 and 500 pages, where a lower value (e.g., 100) is suitable for systems with less memory or lighter workloads, while a higher value (e.g., 400-500) can benefit environments with significant write demands and memory resources.
