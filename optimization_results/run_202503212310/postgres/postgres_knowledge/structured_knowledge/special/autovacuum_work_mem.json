{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob name 'autovacuum_work_mem'. 2. Research the functionality of 'autovacuum_work_mem' in PostgreSQL. 3. Determine if it has any special values that alter its behavior significantly. 4. Note that 'autovacuum_work_mem' is used to set the amount of memory to be used by the autovacuum process. 5. Check if there are special values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a different function. 6. Conclude that 'autovacuum_work_mem' does not have special values that perform a very different function, as it typically accepts positive integers or -1 to use the value of 'work_mem'. 7. Therefore, classify it as not a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
