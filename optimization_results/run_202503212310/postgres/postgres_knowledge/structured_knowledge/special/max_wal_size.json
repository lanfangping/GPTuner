{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question, which is 'max_wal_size'. 2. Determine the function of this knob in PostgreSQL. It controls the maximum size of WAL (Write Ahead Log) files. 3. Check if there are any special values associated with this knob. In PostgreSQL, 'max_wal_size' does not have special values like -1 or 0 that would alter its fundamental behavior. 4. Conclude that since it only has a natural numerical order without special values, it does not qualify as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
