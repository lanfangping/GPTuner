{"think_procedure": "The knob 'hot_standby' in PostgreSQL is used to enable or disable hot standby mode for read-only queries on a standby server. It is a numerical knob that typically accepts values of 0 or 1, where 0 disables hot standby and 1 enables it. The value 0 acts as a special value indicating that hot standby is turned off, which significantly alters the behavior of the database. Therefore, it can be classified as a special knob because it has a special value (0) that changes its functionality.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
