The knob can take values like 'on', 'off', 'local', and 'remote_write', which are not purely numerical. 4. Assess if any of these values represent a special function, such as disabling a feature. 5. Conclude that 'synchronous_commit' does not have a special numerical value like -1 or 0 that would indicate a significant deviation from its regular behavior.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
