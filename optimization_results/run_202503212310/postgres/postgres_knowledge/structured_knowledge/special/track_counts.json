{"think_procedure": "The knob 'track_counts' in PostgreSQL is used to enable or disable the collection of statistics about the number of rows in tables. It typically takes a numerical value (0 or 1), where 0 disables tracking and 1 enables it. Since 0 is a special value that changes the behavior of the knob significantly by disabling the feature, I classify 'track_counts' as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
