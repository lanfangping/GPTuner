{"think_procedure": "The knob 'seq_page_cost' in PostgreSQL is used to indicate the cost of a sequential page fetch. It typically has a numerical value that reflects the cost associated with this operation. However, it does not have special values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a different function or disable a feature. Therefore, it maintains a natural order and does not qualify as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
