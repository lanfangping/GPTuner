{"think_procedure": "The knob 'default_statistics_target' in PostgreSQL is used to set the default statistics target for table columns. It influences the planner's decisions based on the statistics collected. The typical values for this knob are positive integers that represent the level of detail for statistics collection. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that change its fundamental behavior to disable a feature. Therefore, it follows the natural order of numerical knobs without any special cases.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
