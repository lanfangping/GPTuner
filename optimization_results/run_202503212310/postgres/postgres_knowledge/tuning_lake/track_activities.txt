  "suggestion": "To optimize the 'track_activities' knob in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to set its value to 'on' to enable tracking of user activities, which provides valuable insights into ongoing commands and their starting times. This feature is automatically enabled but can only be modified by superusers. While it assists in gathering session-based statistics, monitor any performance impacts and consider enabling it primarily in specific environments where detailed activity tracking is essential."
