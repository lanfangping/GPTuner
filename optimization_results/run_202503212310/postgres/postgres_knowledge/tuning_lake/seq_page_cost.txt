  "suggestion": "To optimize the `seq_page_cost` parameter in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 1.0, which represents the planner's estimate of the cost of fetching a disk page sequentially. Adjust this value to around **0.1 - 0.5** if your storage system is optimized for sequential access. For systems experiencing higher I/O latencies, consider setting a significantly higher value to better reflect the cost of sequential disk fetches."
