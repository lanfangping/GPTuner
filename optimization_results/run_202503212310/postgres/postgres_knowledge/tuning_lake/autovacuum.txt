  "suggestion": "The 'autovacuum' knob controls the activation of the autovacuum launcher daemon in the PostgreSQL server, which is enabled by default. However, it requires 'track_counts' to be enabled for proper functionality. This setting can only be configured in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line, with the option to disable it for individual tables."
