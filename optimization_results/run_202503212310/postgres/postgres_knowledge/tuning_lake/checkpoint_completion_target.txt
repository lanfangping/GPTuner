{
  "suggestion": "To optimize PostgreSQL performance, adjust the 'checkpoint_completion_target' parameter to a value between 0.5 and 0.9, commonly set around 0.7. This setting indicates that PostgreSQL should aim to complete the checkpoint process over about 70% of the checkpoint interval, which helps to smooth I/O activity and reduce performance impact during high write loads. This parameter can be configured in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line."
