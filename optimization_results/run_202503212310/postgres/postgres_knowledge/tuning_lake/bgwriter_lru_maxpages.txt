  "suggestion": "To optimize the `bgwriter_lru_maxpages` parameter in PostgreSQL, configure it in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. This parameter controls the maximum number of buffers that can be written by the background writer in each round. Typically, set its value between 100 and 500 pages based on your workload and available memory; lower values are advisable for systems with less memory or lighter workloads, while higher values can benefit environments with significant write demands."
