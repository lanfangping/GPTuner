  "suggestion": "The 'wal_level' setting in PostgreSQL controls the amount of information written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) and should be set to 'replica' for most production environments to support WAL archiving and replication. The available options include 'minimal', which logs only the necessary information for crash recovery, 'replica', which includes the information needed for replication, and 'logical', which adds data required for logical decoding. It's important to note that the 'wal_level' can only be adjusted at server start."
