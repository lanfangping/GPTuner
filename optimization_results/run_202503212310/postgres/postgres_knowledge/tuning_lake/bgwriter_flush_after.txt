  "suggestion": "To optimize the 'bgwriter_flush_after' parameter in PostgreSQL, set it to a value typically between 32 and 64, while considering your specific workload and conducting performance tests. This parameter helps the OS issue writes to storage after a specified amount of data has been processed by the background writer, which can reduce transaction latency, although it may affect performance negatively in certain scenarios. The value can be configured in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line."
