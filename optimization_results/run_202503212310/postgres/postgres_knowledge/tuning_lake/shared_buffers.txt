  "suggestion": "To configure the `shared_buffers` setting in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to set it to 25% of the system's total RAM for servers with 1GB or more, with a maximum limit of 40%. For smaller systems with less than 1GB RAM, a lower percentage should be used. Additionally, for optimal performance, monitor your configuration through benchmarks and adjust as necessary, especially for non-dedicated servers, while considering OS kernel parameters like `shmmax` and `shmall`."
