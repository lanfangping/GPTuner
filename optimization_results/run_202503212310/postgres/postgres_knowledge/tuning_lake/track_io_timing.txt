  "suggestion": "To enable the `track_io_timing` feature in PostgreSQL, set the value to `on` by adding `track_io_timing = on` in the `postgresql.conf` file. This feature, which is turned off by default to prevent overhead from frequent timing queries, allows collection of I/O timing statistics that can be viewed in `pg_stat_database`, the `BUFFERS` option of `sql-explain`, and using `pg_stat_statements`. Note that only superusers can alter this setting, and you must restart the PostgreSQL server for the changes to take effect."
