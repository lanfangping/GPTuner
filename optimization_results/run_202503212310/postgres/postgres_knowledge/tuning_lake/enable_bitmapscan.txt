  "suggestion": "To enable bitmap scans in PostgreSQL, ensure the `enable_bitmapscan` parameter is set to `on`, which is the default setting. You can set this by executing the SQL command `SET enable_bitmapscan TO 'on';` or by adding `enable_bitmapscan = on` in the `postgresql.conf` file, and typically keep it enabled unless benchmarks suggest otherwise."
