The 'log_destination' knob in PostgreSQL allows users to set the desired log destinations, which can include stderr, csvlog, syslog, and eventlog (for Windows), with the default being stderr only; this parameter can be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line, and if csvlog is included, logs are output in CSV format, requiring the logging_collector to be enabled.
