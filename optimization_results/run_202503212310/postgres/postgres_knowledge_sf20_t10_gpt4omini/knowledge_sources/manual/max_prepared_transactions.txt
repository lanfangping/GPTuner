The 'max_prepared_transactions' knob sets the maximum number of transactions that can be simultaneously in the prepared state, with the default setting being zero which disables the prepared-transaction feature, and it can only be set at server start; it should be at least as large as max_connections if using prepared transactions, and on a standby server, it must be set to the same or higher value than on the master server.
