To optimize the 'full_page_writes' setting in PostgreSQL, you should set it to 'on' for most workloads, especially if you use WAL (Write-Ahead Logging), to ensure data integrity during crashes; this is the default setting, but if you want to minimize the impact on performance in a high-write environment, you could experimentally switch it to 'off' while ensuring your backup strategy is robust, noting that for high durability requirements, keeping it 'on' is generally recommended.
