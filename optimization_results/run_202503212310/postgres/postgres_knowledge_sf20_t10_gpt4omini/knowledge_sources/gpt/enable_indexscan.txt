To optimize the value of the `enable_indexscan` knob in PostgreSQL, set it to `on` (the default value) to allow the query planner to consider index scans for queries, or set it to `off` (setting a numeric value of `0`) to disable index scans entirely, although this may lead to suboptimal query performance in many scenarios.
