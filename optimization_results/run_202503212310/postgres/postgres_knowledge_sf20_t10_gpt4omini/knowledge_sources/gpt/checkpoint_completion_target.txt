To set the `checkpoint_completion_target` in PostgreSQL, it is generally recommended to adjust it to a value between 0.5 and 0.9, with a common setting of around 0.7, which specifies that PostgreSQL should spread the writing of the checkpoint over a duration of approximately 70% of the checkpoint interval to reduce the impact on performance during high write loads.
