To set the 'effective_cache_size' in PostgreSQL, a good rule of thumb is to configure it to about 50-75% of the total available RAM on the server, ensuring to factor in the memory usage of the operating system and other applications; for example, on a server with 16 GB of RAM, you might set it between 8 GB (50%) and 12 GB (75%).
