To set the 'autovacuum' value in PostgreSQL, you can begin with the default settings and adjust the parameters such as `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` (default 20ms), `autovacuum_max_workers` (default 3), and `autovacuum_naptime` (default 60s) based on your workload, aiming for a balance that allows for timely vacuuming without overwhelming system resources.
