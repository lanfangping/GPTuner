To set the 'effective_io_concurrency' parameter in PostgreSQL, start with a value of 1, then adjust it based on your I/O subsystem capabilities, typically setting it to between 2 and 200 for SSDs and 1 to 10 for HDDs, depending on the number of concurrent read operations your storage can efficiently handle.
