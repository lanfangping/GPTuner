To set the `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` value in PostgreSQL, aim for a starting point of 2000 if your database is small and gradually increase it up to 4000-8000 for larger databases, adjusting based on performance and workload; keep in mind that the total cost for autovacuum operations should not exceed the `vacuum_cost_limit` configured for the database to avoid impact on overall performance.
