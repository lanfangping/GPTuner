To set the `statement_timeout` in PostgreSQL, use the command `SET statement_timeout TO '5s';` for a timeout of 5 seconds, or adjust the value as needed, specifying it in milliseconds (e.g., `SET statement_timeout TO '10000ms';` for 10 seconds) to control the maximum duration for query execution before an error is raised.
