To optimize the 'temp_buffers' setting in PostgreSQL, configure it to a value between 1000KB and 8000KB (1MB to 8MB) for systems with low to moderate temporary table usage, while for high temporary table usage, values around 16MB to 32MB may be beneficial, depending on your workload and available memory.
