To set the `vacuum_cost_limit` in PostgreSQL, a recommended approach is to start with a value of around 2000 for a typical workload and adjust it based on your system's I/O capabilities and the level of vacuuming needed, with larger values (up to 10000 or more) for systems with higher I/O throughput.
