To tune the `seq_page_cost` parameter in PostgreSQL, set it typically to a value between **1.0** and **4.0**, with **1.0** indicating that sequential scans are relatively as expensive as random I/O; if your storage system is optimized for sequential access, you might lower it to around **0.1 - 0.5**, while for systems with higher I/O latencies, a value close to **4.0** might be more appropriate.
