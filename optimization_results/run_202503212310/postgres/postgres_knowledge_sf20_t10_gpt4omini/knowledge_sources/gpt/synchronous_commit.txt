To set the PostgreSQL knob `synchronous_commit`, you can adjust it to 'on' (which is the default for full durability), 'off' (for maximum performance with the risk of losing some transactions during a crash), or 'local' (to achieve a balance that allows transactions to be acknowledged once the commit is logged locally, generally recommended for high-performance systems); for example, with high availability setups, you may consider using 'remote_write' (to wait for acknowledgment from replicas) for improved data safety, especially if the system experiences frequent crashes.
