{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age' is used to set the maximum age of multixact IDs before they are frozen. It typically has a natural order as higher values indicate a longer lifespan for multixact IDs. There are no documented special values for this knob that would change its typical operation, such as -1 or 0, which would indicate a different behavior. Therefore, it does not break the natural order of numerical settings.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
