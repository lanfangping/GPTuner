{"think_procedure": "The knob 'max_connections' in PostgreSQL determines the maximum number of concurrent connections to the database. This is a numerical setting that can be adjusted to control the load on the server. The values for 'max_connections' are typically positive integers, and there are no special values like -1 or 0 that alter its function significantly. Therefore, it does not break the natural order of numerical knobs. It is used for scaling the database's ability to handle connections rather than disabling a feature or changing its fundamental behavior.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
