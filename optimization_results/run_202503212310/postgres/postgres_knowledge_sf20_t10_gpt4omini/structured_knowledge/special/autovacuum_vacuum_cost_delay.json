{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' is used to control the delay between vacuum operations in PostgreSQL. It is a numerical setting that typically takes positive integer values to set the delay in milliseconds. Special values such as -1 or 0 would indicate a different behavior, such as disabling the autovacuum feature or having no delay. In this case, the knob does not have any special values that change its fundamental operation. Therefore, it follows a natural order with positive values only.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
