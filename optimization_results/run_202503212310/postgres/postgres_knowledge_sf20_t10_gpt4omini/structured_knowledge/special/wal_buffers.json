{"think_procedure": "The knob 'wal_buffers' in PostgreSQL controls the amount of memory allocated for write-ahead log (WAL) buffers. It is a numerical value that typically has a natural order, where higher values allow for more WAL data to be buffered before being written to disk. However, it does not have special values like -1 or 0 that change its fundamental behavior. Therefore, it does not break the natural order or represent a special function when set to a specific value. It behaves as a regular numerical knob throughout its range.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
