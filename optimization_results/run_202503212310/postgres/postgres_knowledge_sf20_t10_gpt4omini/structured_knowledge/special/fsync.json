{"think_procedure": "The knob 'fsync' in PostgreSQL controls whether the database engine flushes data to disk after every transaction. Its typical values are 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled), where 0 means that the database may not be fully durable, and 1 ensures data durability. The value 0 acts as a special value that disables the default behavior of fsync, making it a special knob. Therefore, it has a natural order with regular values but also includes a special value that has a distinct meaning.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
