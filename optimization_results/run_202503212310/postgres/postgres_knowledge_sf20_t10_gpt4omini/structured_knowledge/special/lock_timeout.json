{"think_procedure": "The lock_timeout knob in PostgreSQL defines the maximum time to wait for a lock to be acquired. It accepts a time interval in milliseconds. The natural order of this knob is that higher values allow for longer wait times before timing out. However, if set to 0, it indicates that the operation should not wait for a lock, effectively disabling the waiting behavior. This behavior indicates a special function when set to 0, which breaks the natural order of the numerical values. Therefore, I classify this as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
