{"think_procedure": "The knob 'work_mem' in PostgreSQL is used to configure the amount of memory allocated for internal sort operations and hash tables before writing to temporary disk files. It typically takes a positive integer value representing the amount of memory in kilobytes. There are no special values such as -1 or 0 that would change its functionality to disable a feature or perform a different operation. Therefore, it does not break the natural order of numerical values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
