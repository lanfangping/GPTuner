{"think_procedure": "The knob 'checkpoint_segments' in PostgreSQL controls the number of log file segments that can be filled before a checkpoint is triggered. It is a numerical knob with a natural order, as increasing the value allows for more log segments. However, it does not have special values like -1 or 0 that change its function; it only accepts positive integers. Therefore, it does not break the natural order in the way that a special knob would.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
