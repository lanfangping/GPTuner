{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob: log_lock_waits is a configuration setting in PostgreSQL. 2. Determine the function of the knob: This knob controls whether to log lock waits. 3. Check for special values: A special knob typically has values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior significantly. 4. Analyze the behavior of log_lock_waits: In PostgreSQL, if log_lock_waits is set to 0, it disables logging of lock waits, which is a special behavior. 5. Conclude if it qualifies as a special knob: Since it has a special value (0) that alters its functionality, it qualifies as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
