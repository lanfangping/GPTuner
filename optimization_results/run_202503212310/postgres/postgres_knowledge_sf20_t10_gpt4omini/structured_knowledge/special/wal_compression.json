{"think_procedure": "The knob 'wal_compression' in PostgreSQL is used to control whether to compress the Write-Ahead Logs (WAL). It typically has values like 'on' or 'off', and does not have special values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a different function. Therefore, it does not break the natural order of numerical knobs. Since it does not have a special value that alters its functionality significantly, it is not classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
