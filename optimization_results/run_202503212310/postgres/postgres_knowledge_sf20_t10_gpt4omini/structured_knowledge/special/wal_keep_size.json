{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the purpose of the 'wal_keep_size' knob in PostgreSQL, which is used to specify the maximum size of the write-ahead log (WAL) files to keep. 2. Determine if the knob has any special values that alter its behavior significantly. 3. Check if setting 'wal_keep_size' to -1 or 0 changes its function, such as disabling WAL retention. 4. Conclude whether 'wal_keep_size' can be classified as a 'special knob' based on the presence of such special values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
