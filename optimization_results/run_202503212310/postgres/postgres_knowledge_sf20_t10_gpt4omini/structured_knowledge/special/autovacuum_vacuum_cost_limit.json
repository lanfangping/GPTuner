{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' in PostgreSQL controls the cost limit for autovacuum operations. It is a numerical setting that determines how much work the autovacuum process can do before it pauses to allow other operations to proceed. The value can be set to a positive integer, which indicates the cost limit, or it can be set to special values like -1 or 0. In this case, -1 typically means that there is no limit and the autovacuum will run without restriction, which is a special behavior. Therefore, it can be classified as a special knob due to the presence of this special value that alters its normal operational behavior.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
