{"think_procedure": "The 'transaction_isolation' knob in PostgreSQL controls the isolation level of transactions. It can take values such as 'read uncommitted', 'read committed', 'repeatable read', and 'serializable'. These values have a natural order in terms of increasing isolation. However, it does not have a special value like -1 or 0 that would indicate a different function or disable a feature. Therefore, it behaves as a regular numerical knob without any special cases.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
