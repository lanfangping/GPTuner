{"think_procedure": "The 'wal_level' knob in PostgreSQL controls the amount of information written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL). It can take values such as 'minimal', 'replica', and 'logical'. These values have a natural order related to the amount of data logged. However, it does not have special values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a significantly different behavior or disable a feature. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob without any special cases.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
