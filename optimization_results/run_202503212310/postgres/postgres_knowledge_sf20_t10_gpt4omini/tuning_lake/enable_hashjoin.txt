{"suggestion": "To optimize the use of the `enable_hashjoin` knob in PostgreSQL, set its value to `on` to allow the query planner to utilize hash join operations for queries, as this can enhance performance. However, it is important to monitor performance closely and consider setting it to `off` if you observe any performance degradation in cases where hash joins are not beneficial."}
