  "suggestion": "To optimize the 'full_page_writes' setting in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to keep it set to 'on'. This setting writes the entire content of each disk page to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) during the first modification after a checkpoint, which enhances data integrity during system crashes. Although this may increase the amount of data written to the WAL, the increased durability and protection against data corruption generally outweigh the performance costs for most workloads."
