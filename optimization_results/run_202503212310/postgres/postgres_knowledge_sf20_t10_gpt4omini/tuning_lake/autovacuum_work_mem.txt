{
  "suggestion": "To configure the `autovacuum_work_mem` value in PostgreSQL, set it to a range between 65536 kB to 1048576 kB, based on your system's available memory and workload characteristics. This setting specifies the maximum memory each autovacuum worker process can utilize, defaulting to -1 kilobytes, which means it will instead use the value of `maintenance_work_mem`. Ensure that the set value does not exceed the limits of the configured `work_mem` or the overall system memory."
