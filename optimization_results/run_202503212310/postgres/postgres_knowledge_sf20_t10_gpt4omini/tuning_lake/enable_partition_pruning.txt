  "suggestion": "To enable partition pruning in PostgreSQL and optimize query performance, ensure that the 'enable_partition_pruning' parameter is set to 'on' in the 'postgresql.conf' file, as this allows the query planner to exclude unneeded partitions from query plans for partitioned tables, thus improving execution efficiency."
