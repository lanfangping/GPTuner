  "suggestion": "Set the `log_min_duration_statement` parameter in PostgreSQL to a value such as 250 milliseconds to log the duration of each completed statement that runs for at least the specified time, helping to identify unoptimized queries. This parameter can be adjusted by superusers and can also be set to zero to log all durations. Consider using a value between 1 and 60000 milliseconds for broader performance tracking, and utilize tools like pg_stat_statements or pg_stat_monitor to further understand query performance."
