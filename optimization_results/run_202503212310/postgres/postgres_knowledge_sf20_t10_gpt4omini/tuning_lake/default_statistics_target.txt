  "suggestion": "The `default_statistics_target` in PostgreSQL sets the default statistics target for table columns without a specific target, potentially improving the planner's estimate accuracy while increasing analysis time. For optimal query performance, start with a value around 250 for most applications; medium-sized systems may work well with 200, while large systems might require values closer to 500 or 1000. Always assess the impact of adjusting this value, especially in the context of large tables."
