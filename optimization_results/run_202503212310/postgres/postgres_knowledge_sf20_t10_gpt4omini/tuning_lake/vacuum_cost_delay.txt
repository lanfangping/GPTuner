{"suggestion": "To configure the `vacuum_cost_delay` parameter in PostgreSQL, begin with a default value of 20 milliseconds and adjust in increments of 10 to 100 milliseconds according to your system's workload and performance needs. Positive values activate cost-based vacuuming, and while it's possible to set lower values, large delays are not recommended. Monitor the effects on system responsiveness and vacuuming efficiency, especially on busy systems where reducing the delay can enhance background writer activity."}
