{
  "suggestion": "Set the 'wal_keep_size' parameter in PostgreSQL to a value that specifies the size of past log file segments, in megabytes, to be retained in the pg_wal directory for streaming replication. This value should typically be between 1 GB and 10 GB, ensuring it supports your replication needs without exceeding the total disk space available for WAL files. The default value of zero means no extra segments are kept for standby purposes."
