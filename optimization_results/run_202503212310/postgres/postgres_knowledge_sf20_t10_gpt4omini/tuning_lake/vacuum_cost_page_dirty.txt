  "suggestion": "To optimize vacuum operations in PostgreSQL, set the 'vacuum_cost_page_dirty' parameter, which represents the estimated cost when a vacuum modifies a previously clean block. A recommended starting value is between **20** and **100**, with adjustments based on your system's workload; lower values are better for high transaction environments, while higher values may be suitable for systems that can handle more aggressive vacuuming."
