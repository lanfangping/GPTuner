The 'synchronous_commit' knob controls whether transaction commit waits for WAL records to be written to disk before reporting success, with options including 'on' (default, waits for local disk and standby replication), 'remote_apply' (waits for standby to apply changes), 'remote_write' (waits for standby to write changes), 'local' (waits for local disk only), and 'off' (no wait, risking up to three times wal_writer_delay of data loss on crash), balancing performance and durability.
