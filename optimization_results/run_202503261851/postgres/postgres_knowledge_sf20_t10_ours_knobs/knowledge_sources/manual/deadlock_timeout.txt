The 'deadlock_timeout' knob is a setting that determines the duration to wait on a lock before checking for a deadlock condition, with the default set at one second (1s), and can be increased to reduce unnecessary deadlock checks but may delay reporting of actual deadlock errors; it ideally should exceed typical transaction time to increase chances of a lock being released before a deadlock check, and it also determines the wait time before a log message is issued about the lock wait when log_lock_waits is set.
