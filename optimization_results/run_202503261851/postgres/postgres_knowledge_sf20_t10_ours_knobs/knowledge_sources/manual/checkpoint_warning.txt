The 'checkpoint_warning' knob logs a warning message if checkpoints, triggered by the filling of WAL segment files, occur within a specified time frame (default is 30 seconds), suggesting that 'max_wal_size' should be increased; setting it to zero disables the warning, and no warnings are issued if 'checkpoint_timeout' is less than 'checkpoint_warning', with changes only applicable via the postgresql.conf file or server command line.
