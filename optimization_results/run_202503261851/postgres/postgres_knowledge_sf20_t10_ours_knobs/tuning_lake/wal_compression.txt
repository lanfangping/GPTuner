**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

The 'wal_compression' setting in PostgreSQL, which is off by default, can be enabled by superusers to compress full page images written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL). This compression reduces the WAL volume and may help prevent data corruption. However, it does come with a trade-off: it increases CPU usage due to the additional compression and decompression processes.
