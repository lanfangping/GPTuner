Determine the nature of the knob: 'jit' controls Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for query execution in PostgreSQL. 3. Check for special values: The 'jit' knob can typically be set to different numerical values to control its behavior, but it does not have a special value like -1 or 0 that fundamentally changes its function. 4. Conclude that 'jit' behaves like a regular numerical knob without special values that break the natural order. Therefore, it is not classified as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
