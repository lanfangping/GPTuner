{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the purpose of the 'transaction_isolation' knob in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand that it controls the isolation level of transactions, which affects how transactions interact with each other. 3. Check if the knob has any special values that alter its normal behavior. 4. Determine if any of these special values (like -1 or 0) have a unique function that deviates from the standard numerical order. 5. Conclude whether 'transaction_isolation' can be classified as a special knob based on the presence of such special values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
