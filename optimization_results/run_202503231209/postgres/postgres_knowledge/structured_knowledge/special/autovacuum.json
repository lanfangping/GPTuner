{"think_procedure": "First, I need to determine if the 'autovacuum' knob in PostgreSQL has special values that deviate from its normal numerical behavior. The 'autovacuum' setting controls the automatic vacuuming of tables to reclaim storage and maintain performance. It can be set to various numerical values to adjust its behavior, but it can also be set to '0' to disable it entirely. This indicates that '0' is a special value that changes its function significantly. Therefore, I classify 'autovacuum' as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
