{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' controls the behavior of the autovacuum process in PostgreSQL, specifically related to how much of the database needs to be modified before autovacuum kicks in. This knob has a natural numerical order, as it represents a scaling factor. However, it does not have any special values like -1 or 0 that would change its functionality to a different operation. Therefore, it does not break the natural order and behaves like a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
