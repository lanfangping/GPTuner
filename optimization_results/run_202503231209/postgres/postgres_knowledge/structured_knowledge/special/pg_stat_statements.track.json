{"think_procedure": "The knob 'pg_stat_statements.track' in PostgreSQL controls what types of statements are tracked by the pg_stat_statements module. The possible values for this knob include 'none', 'all', and 'top'. These values do not have a natural numerical order, as they represent different categories of tracking. The value 'none' effectively disables tracking, which indicates a special function. Therefore, it can be classified as a special knob because it has a special value that alters its behavior significantly.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "none"}
