{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' in PostgreSQL controls the minimum number of tuples that must be dead before the autovacuum process will consider vacuuming a table. It has a natural order of numerical values, as higher values indicate a higher threshold for triggering autovacuum. However, it does not have a special value like -1 or 0 that alters its fundamental behavior. Hence, it behaves like a regular numerical knob without any special functionality.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
