{"think_procedure": "The fsync knob in PostgreSQL controls whether the database will flush its data to disk after every transaction. The default value is typically set to 1, which means that fsync is enabled and data is safely written to disk. If set to 0, fsync is disabled, which can lead to data loss in the event of a crash. Therefore, since the value of 0 has a special meaning (disabling a critical safety feature), it qualifies as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
