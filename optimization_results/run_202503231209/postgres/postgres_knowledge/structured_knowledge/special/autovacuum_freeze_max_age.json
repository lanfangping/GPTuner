{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' controls the maximum age of tuples before they are frozen by the autovacuum process. It is a numerical setting that typically has a natural order, as a higher value allows for longer retention of tuples before freezing. However, it does not have a special value like -1 or 0 that alters its function significantly. Therefore, it behaves as a regular numerical knob without special cases.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
