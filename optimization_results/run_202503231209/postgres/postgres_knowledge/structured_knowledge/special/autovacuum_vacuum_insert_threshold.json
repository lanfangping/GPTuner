{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' is used to determine the minimum number of inserted tuples needed to trigger a vacuum operation in PostgreSQL. It is a numerical setting that has a natural order, as higher values indicate a higher threshold for triggering the vacuum. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that alter its fundamental operation, meaning it always behaves in a regular manner based on the numerical input provided. Therefore, it does not qualify as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
