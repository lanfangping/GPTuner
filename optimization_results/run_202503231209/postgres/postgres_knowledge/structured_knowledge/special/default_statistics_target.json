{"think_procedure": "The knob 'default_statistics_target' in PostgreSQL is used to set the default statistics target for table columns. It affects the planner's ability to make decisions about query execution based on the statistics collected. The typical values for this knob are numeric, indicating the level of detail for statistics collection. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that would disable a feature or change its behavior fundamentally. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob without any special function.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
