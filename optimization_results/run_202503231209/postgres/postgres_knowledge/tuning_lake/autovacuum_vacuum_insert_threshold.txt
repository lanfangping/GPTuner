{
  "suggestion": "The `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set in the postgresql.conf file or through the server command line to control when a VACUUM operation is triggered. This parameter determines the number of tuples that must be inserted before autovacuum executes. For optimal performance, consider starting with a value around 100,000, adjusting it as necessary for individual tables based on their specific insert patterns."
