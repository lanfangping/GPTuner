  "suggestion": "To configure the `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor` in PostgreSQL, set it in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line. This parameter defaults to 0.2 (20%) and determines a fraction of the table size added to the `autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold` to decide when to trigger a VACUUM. A typical value of 0.1 can balance timely vacuuming and system performance, and you can adjust the setting lower for busy systems and higher for less active environments, with the option to override it for individual tables."
