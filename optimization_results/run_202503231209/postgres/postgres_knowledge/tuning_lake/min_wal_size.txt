  "suggestion": "Set the `min_wal_size` parameter in PostgreSQL to a value between 2 MB and 4 GB, considering your workload requirements and available storage. This adjustment is essential to effectively recycle old WAL files during checkpoints, especially to accommodate spikes in WAL usage during peak activity or large batch jobs, while also ensuring that it is sufficient to prevent frequent checkpoints."
