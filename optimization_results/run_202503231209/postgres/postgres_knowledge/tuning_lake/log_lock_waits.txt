  "suggestion": "Enable the 'log_lock_waits' parameter in PostgreSQL by setting it to 'on' either in the configuration file (postgresql.conf) or through a SQL command (`ALTER SYSTEM SET log_lock_waits = on;`). This parameter, which is off by default and can only be modified by superusers, helps diagnose potential performance issues related to lock contention by logging sessions that wait longer than the 'deadlock_timeout' to acquire a lock."
