  "suggestion": "To optimize the 'autovacuum_naptime' setting in PostgreSQL, begin with the default value of 60 seconds, as this setting determines the minimum delay between autovacuum runs. Adjust the value based on the workload and vacuuming behavior, with common adjustments ranging from 30 to 300 seconds, depending on the frequency of write operations and the size of the database. This setting can be configured in the postgresql.conf file or via the server command line."
