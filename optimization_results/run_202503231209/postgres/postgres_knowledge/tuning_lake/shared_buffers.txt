  "suggestion": "Set the `shared_buffers` parameter in PostgreSQL to 25% of the system's total RAM for optimal performance, ensuring it does not exceed 40%. For systems with 1GB or more RAM, this typically ranges from 128MB to a maximum of 8GB. Additionally, on non-dedicated servers, consider adjusting this value based on benchmarks and the memory requirements of each PostgreSQL instance, as it is related to the OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`."
