{"suggestion": "To optimize performance for queries involving partitioned tables in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to set the `enable_partitionwise_aggregate` knob to `off` (i.e., `SET enable_partitionwise_aggregate = off;`). This allows for efficient aggregations to be performed at the partition level, especially when dealing with a significant number of partitions or large datasets. Although this feature can enhance query efficiency, it is disabled by default to prevent increased CPU and memory usage during planning, which can be significant depending on the number of partitions."}
