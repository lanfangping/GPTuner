  "suggestion": "The 'jit' (Just-In-Time compilation) knob in PostgreSQL, which is enabled by default, can be configured by setting the `jit` parameter to `on` for enabling JIT or `off` to disable it. While JIT can enhance performance for certain workloads, it may be advisable to disable it for OLTP systems with simple queries."
