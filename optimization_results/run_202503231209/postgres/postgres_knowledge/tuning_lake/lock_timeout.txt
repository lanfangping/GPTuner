  "suggestion": "To configure the 'lock_timeout' in PostgreSQL, set it to a value that balances performance and contention, typically starting at 100 milliseconds (0.1 seconds) and ensuring it does not exceed 2000 milliseconds. This timeout defines a limit in milliseconds for aborting statements that wait longer than the specified duration while attempting to acquire locks on database objects. The timeout applies separately to each lock acquisition attempt and is distinct from the 'statement_timeout'. Adjust the value based on observed wait times and application requirements."
