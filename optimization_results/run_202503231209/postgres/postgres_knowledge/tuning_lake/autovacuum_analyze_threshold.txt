    "suggestion": "To optimize the `autovacuum_analyze_threshold` parameter in PostgreSQL, customize it in the postgresql.conf file or through server command line to control when an ANALYZE operation is triggered based on the number of tuples inserted, updated, or deleted. For small tables, set the threshold to 50, while for larger tables or those with low update/delete activity, adjust the value to between 100 and 500, ensuring the configuration aligns with the specific workload and query patterns."
