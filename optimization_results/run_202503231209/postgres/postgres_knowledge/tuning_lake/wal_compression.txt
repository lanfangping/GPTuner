  "suggestion": "To set the `wal_compression` parameter in PostgreSQL, enable it by setting the value to `on` in your `postgresql.conf` file. This setting compresses full page images written to WAL, reducing WAL volume and potentially preventing data corruption. However, be aware that enabling WAL compression may increase CPU usage due to the compression and decompression processes, so monitor system performance accordingly. Note that this feature is off by default and can only be changed by superusers."
