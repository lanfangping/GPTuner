To set the `wal_buffers` parameter in PostgreSQL, start with a default value of -1, which corresponds to approximately 3% of your `shared_buffers`, and can be manually adjusted. Any value below 32kB will be treated as 32kB. This setting refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data that has not yet been written to disk and is written to disk at every transaction commit, potentially enhancing write performance on busy servers. Regularly monitor performance, especially in systems with heavy write operations, and make adjustments as necessary.
