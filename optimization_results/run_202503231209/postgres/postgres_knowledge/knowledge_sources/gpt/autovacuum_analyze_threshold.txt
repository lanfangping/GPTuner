The value of the `autovacuum_analyze_threshold` parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to a minimum of 50 (the default setting) for small tables and can be increased to 100-500 for larger tables or those with very low update/delete activity to ensure efficient analysis, with adjustments based on the specific workload and query patterns.
