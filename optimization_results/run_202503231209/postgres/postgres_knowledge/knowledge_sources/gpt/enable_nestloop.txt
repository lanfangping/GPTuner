To set the `enable_nestloop` knob in PostgreSQL, you can adjust its value to either `on` or `off`, where setting it to `on` allows the optimizer to choose nested loop joins (typically the default), while setting it to `off` may be beneficial in scenarios where nested loops are inefficient, especially when dealing with larger datasets or on systems with high join complexity.
