To set the `autovacuum_max_workers` parameter in PostgreSQL, configure it based on your system's workload and available resources, typically starting with a value of 3 to 5 workers for small to medium databases, and increasing up to 10 or more for larger databases, while ensuring it does not exceed the total configured parallel workers (sum of autovacuum workers and max_parallel_workers) to avoid resource contention.
