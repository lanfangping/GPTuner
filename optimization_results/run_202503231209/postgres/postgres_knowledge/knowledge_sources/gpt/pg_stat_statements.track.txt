To set the `pg_stat_statements.track` parameter in PostgreSQL, you can use the `ALTER SYSTEM` command to specify its value as `'all'` (to track all statements), `'top'` (to track only the top-level statements), or `'none'` (to track no statements), which can be done by executing `ALTER SYSTEM SET pg_stat_statements.track = 'all';` followed by a `SELECT pg_reload_conf();` to apply the change.
