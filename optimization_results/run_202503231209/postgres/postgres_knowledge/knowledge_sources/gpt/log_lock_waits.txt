To set the `log_lock_waits` parameter in PostgreSQL, enable it by setting the value to `on` in the configuration file (postgresql.conf) or through a SQL command (`ALTER SYSTEM SET log_lock_waits = on;`), which allows logging of lock waits longer than the default threshold of 1 second; you can adjust the threshold for lock waits by modifying the `deadlock_timeout` parameter, typically set between 1 to 10 seconds based on your application's needs.
