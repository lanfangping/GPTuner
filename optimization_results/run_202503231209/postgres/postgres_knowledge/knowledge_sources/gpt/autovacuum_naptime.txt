To optimize the `autovacuum_naptime` setting in PostgreSQL, it is generally recommended to start with a default value of 60 seconds and adjust it based on the workload and behavior of vacuuming processes, with common values ranging from 30 to 300 seconds depending on the frequency of write operations and the size of the database.
