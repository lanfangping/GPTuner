To configure the 'transaction_isolation' setting in PostgreSQL, you can set it to one of the following values based on your application's needs: 'read committed' (the default), 'repeatable read', or 'serializable', with 'read committed' generally performing well for most workloads; you can implement this by executing the command `SET transaction_isolation = 'your_desired_level';` in a SQL session or by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file and restarting the server for a permanent change.
