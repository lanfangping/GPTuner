To set the `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` parameter in PostgreSQL, you can start with a value of 20 milliseconds (e.g., `SET autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay = 20ms;`) and adjust based on system performance and workload, increasing it if you need to reduce the impact on query responsiveness or decreasing it to allow more aggressive vacuuming if the system is underutilized.
