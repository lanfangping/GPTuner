To set the 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' in PostgreSQL, it is generally recommended to start with the default value of 50,000 tuples for small to medium-sized databases, but you may increase it to 100,000 or more for larger databases to reduce autovacuum frequency and allow for more efficient vacuuming by accumulating more dead tuples before triggering the process.
