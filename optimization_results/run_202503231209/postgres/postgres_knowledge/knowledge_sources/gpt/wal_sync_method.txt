The `wal_sync_method` in PostgreSQL can be set to `fsync` for general use, but for improved performance on modern systems, it's often recommended to use `open_sync` or `fdatasync` (where applicable), with values like `open_sync` for Linux, which can result in better throughput, while ensuring data integrity with the default being set to `fsync`, particularly on older or less capable hardware.
