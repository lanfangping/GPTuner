To set the `default_transaction_isolation` value in PostgreSQL, you can configure it in the `postgresql.conf` file or via SQL command by using `SET default_transaction_isolation = 'read committed';` for the typical isolation level, or other options like `'read uncommitted'`, `'repeatable read'`, or `'serializable'` based on your application's needs, with `'read committed'` being the most common choice.
