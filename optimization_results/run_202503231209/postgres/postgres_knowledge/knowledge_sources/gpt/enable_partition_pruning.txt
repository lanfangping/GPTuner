To enable partition pruning in PostgreSQL, set the `enable_partition_pruning` parameter to `on` in the `postgresql.conf` file or through a session-specific command, as it is enabled by default in PostgreSQL version 10 and later; if you need to specifically adjust tuning, consider setting it when dealing with large partitioned tables where the number of partitions exceeds 100 to ensure optimal query performance.
