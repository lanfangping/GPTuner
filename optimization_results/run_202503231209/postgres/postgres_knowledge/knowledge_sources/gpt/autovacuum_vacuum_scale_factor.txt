To set the `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` in PostgreSQL, it is generally recommended to adjust it between 0.1 and 0.5, with the default being 0.2; for instance, consider setting it to 0.1 if your tables experience high update/delete activity and require more frequent autovacuuming to maintain performance.
