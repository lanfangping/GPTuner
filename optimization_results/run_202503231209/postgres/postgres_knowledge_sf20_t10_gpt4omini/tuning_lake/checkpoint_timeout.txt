  "suggestion": "To optimize the 'checkpoint_timeout' in PostgreSQL, configure it to a value typically between 300 seconds (5 minutes) and 900 seconds. This setting controls the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints. While raising the value may improve I/O usage by reducing the frequency of checkpoints, it could result in longer recovery times after a crash and may cause larger I/O spikes. Adjust this parameter based on your workload and performance testing to find the optimal balance between checkpoint frequency and I/O overhead."
