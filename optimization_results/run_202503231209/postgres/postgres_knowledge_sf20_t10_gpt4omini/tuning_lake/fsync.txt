  "suggestion": "For optimal data durability in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to enable the `fsync` knob, as it ensures data integrity by physically writing updates to disk using system calls like fsync(). This protects against data corruption during crashes. However, in specific scenarios such as initial database loads or batch processing where performance is critical, it can be disabled for a notable performance boost, albeit with an increased risk of unrecoverable data loss."
