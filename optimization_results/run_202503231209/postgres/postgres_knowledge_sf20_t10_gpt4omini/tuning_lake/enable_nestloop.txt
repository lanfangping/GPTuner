    "suggestion": "To set the 'enable_nestloop' knob in PostgreSQL, you can adjust its value to 'on' or 'off'. By default, it is enabled, allowing the optimizer to choose nested loop joins. While it cannot be completely suppressed, setting it to 'off' may be advantageous in situations where nested loops are inefficient, particularly with larger datasets or high join complexities."
