  "suggestion": "Set the `bgwriter_delay` parameter in PostgreSQL in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line to a duration of around 200 milliseconds to balance background writer activity effectively. Adjusting this value can optimize performance based on system load, but avoid setting it too low on busy systems to prevent overwhelming the system."
