  "suggestion": "The 'checkpoint_completion_target' setting in PostgreSQL should be adjusted to optimize the I/O load of writing WAL files over time. A recommended starting value is 0.7, which represents a fraction of the checkpoint interval defined by 'checkpoint_timeout'. This setting can be modified in the postgresql.conf file or through the server command line, and it is common to increase this value on development instances to further smooth I/O activity during checkpoints."
