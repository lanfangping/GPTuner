  "suggestion": "To optimize performance and ensure a crash-safe configuration in PostgreSQL, set the `wal_sync_method` to one of the options like `fdatasync` or `fsync`, depending on your hardware capabilities. The `wal_sync_method` controls how WAL updates are forced to disk, with values including `open_datasync`, `fdatasync`, `fsync`, `fsync_writethrough`, and `open_sync`. Consider using `fdatasync` for improved performance on modern systems."
