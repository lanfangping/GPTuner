  "suggestion": "To set the `pg_stat_statements.track` parameter in PostgreSQL, use the `ALTER SYSTEM` command to specify its value. You can set it to `'all'` to track all statements, `'top'` to track only the top-level statements, or `'none'` to track no statements. Execute the command `ALTER SYSTEM SET pg_stat_statements.track = 'all';` followed by `SELECT pg_reload_conf();` to apply the change."
