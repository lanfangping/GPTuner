  "suggestion": "To prevent multixact ID wraparound in PostgreSQL, set the 'autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age' parameter to a recommended value of 150,000,000 for optimal performance in heavily updated databases. This parameter specifies the maximum age, in multixacts, that can be reached before an automatic VACUUM operation is triggered, and it can only be configured at server start. The default setting is 400 million multixacts."
