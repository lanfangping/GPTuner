  "suggestion": "To optimize the autovacuum process in PostgreSQL, adjust the 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' setting in the postgresql.conf file or via server command line. This threshold determines when a VACUUM is triggered based on the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples. For small to medium-sized databases, it is advisable to start with the default value, but for larger databases, consider increasing it to 100,000 or more to reduce the frequency of autovacuum operations, allowing for more efficient vacuuming by gathering more dead tuples before the process is initiated. Additionally, this setting can be customized for individual tables by altering their storage parameters."
