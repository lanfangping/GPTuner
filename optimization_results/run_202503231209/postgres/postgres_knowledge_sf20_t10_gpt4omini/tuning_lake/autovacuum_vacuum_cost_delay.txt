  "suggestion": "To configure the `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` parameter in PostgreSQL, set it in the `postgresql.conf` file or via the server command line, with the option to override it for individual tables. A recommended starting value is 20 milliseconds (`SET autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay = 20;`), which you can adjust based on system performance and workload, increasing it to reduce the impact on query responsiveness or decreasing it to allow more aggressive vacuuming if system resources are underutilized."
