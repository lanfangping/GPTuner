  "suggestion": "Set the `default_statistics_target` in PostgreSQL to 100 for general use, as this is the default value. For medium-sized systems, a value around 200 is typically effective, while large tables may require an increase to 500 to enhance the planner's estimates. Be aware that raising this value can lead to increased planning time and memory usage."
