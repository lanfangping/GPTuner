  "suggestion": "To configure the `random_page_cost` parameter in PostgreSQL, begin with the default value of 4.0. If you are using SSD storage, reduce this value to around 1.1 to 1.2 to accurately reflect faster access times; for traditional HDDs, a value of 3.0 to 4.0 may be more suitable. This adjustment should take into account the disk technology's random access profile, the cache rate, and the relative size of the database to server memory."
