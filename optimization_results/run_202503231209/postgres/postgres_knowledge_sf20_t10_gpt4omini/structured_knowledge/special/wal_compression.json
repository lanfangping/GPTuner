{"think_procedure": "The knob 'wal_compression' in PostgreSQL is used to enable or disable compression for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL). It is a numerical knob that can be set to different compression algorithms or disabled. The special values for this knob are not clearly defined as breaking the natural order, as it does not have a specific value like -1 or 0 that changes its fundamental operation. Instead, it operates based on the chosen compression method, which can be considered a regular numerical setting.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
