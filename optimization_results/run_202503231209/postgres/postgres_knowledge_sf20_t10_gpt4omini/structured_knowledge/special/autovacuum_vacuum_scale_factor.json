{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' in PostgreSQL is used to determine the fraction of the table size that must be exceeded before a vacuum operation is triggered. It is a numerical setting that can take values between 0 and 1. However, it does not have any special values like -1 or 0 that would indicate a different function. Therefore, it follows a natural order and does not behave differently when set to certain values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
