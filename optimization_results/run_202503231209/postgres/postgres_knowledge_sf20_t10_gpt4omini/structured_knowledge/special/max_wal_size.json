{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question, which is 'max_wal_size'. 2. Understand the purpose of 'max_wal_size', which is to set the maximum size of the Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) in PostgreSQL. 3. Determine if there are any special values associated with this knob, such as -1 or 0, that would indicate a different operational mode. 4. Check the PostgreSQL documentation for 'max_wal_size' to see if it has any special behavior when set to specific values. 5. Conclude that 'max_wal_size' does not have special values like -1 or 0 that change its function significantly; it operates within a numerical range instead. 6. Therefore, classify 'max_wal_size' as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
