{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_work_mem' is used to set the amount of memory to be used by the autovacuum process. It is a numerical setting that controls resource allocation. There are no documented special values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior significantly. Thus, it follows the natural order of numerical settings, and does not disable any feature when set to a regular numerical value. Therefore, it does not qualify as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
