{"think_procedure": "The knob 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' is used to control the threshold for the autovacuum process in PostgreSQL. It is a numerical setting that typically adjusts the ratio of the number of tuples that need to be inserted, updated, or deleted before an autovacuum is triggered. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior drastically. Therefore, it maintains a natural order and does not have a special function when set to certain values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
