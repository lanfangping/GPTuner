{"think_procedure": "The knob 'random_page_cost' in PostgreSQL is used to influence the planner's decision on whether to use an index scan or a sequential scan. It typically has a numerical value that represents the cost of fetching a random page from disk. There are no special values like -1 or 0 that change its fundamental behavior in a significant way. Therefore, it follows a natural order based on its numerical value and does not have a special operation associated with it.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
