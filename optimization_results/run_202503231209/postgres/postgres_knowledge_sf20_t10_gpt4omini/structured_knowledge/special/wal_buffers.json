Determine if 'wal_buffers' has any special values that alter its functionality, such as -1 or 0. 4. Conclude that 'wal_buffers' does not have any special values that break the natural order, as it primarily accepts positive integers to configure the size of the write-ahead log buffers. 5. Since there are no special values, classify 'wal_buffers' as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
