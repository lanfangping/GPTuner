{"think_procedure": "The knob 'checkpoint_completion_target' is used to specify the target duration for checkpoint completion in PostgreSQL. It is a numerical setting that typically takes values between 0 and 1, where 0 means no target and 1 means the checkpoint should take as long as possible. The values are continuous and do not include special values like -1 or 0 that would alter its function significantly. Therefore, it behaves consistently as a regular numerical knob without any special functions associated with specific values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
