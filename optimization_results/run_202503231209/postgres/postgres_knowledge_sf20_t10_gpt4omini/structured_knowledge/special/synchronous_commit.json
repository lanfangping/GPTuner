{"think_procedure": "The knob 'synchronous_commit' in PostgreSQL controls whether transactions are committed synchronously or asynchronously. A value of 'on' means transactions are committed synchronously, while 'off' means they are committed asynchronously. The special value 'off' allows for faster transaction processing by not waiting for the commit to be confirmed by the server, which is a different function compared to the synchronous operation. Thus, it has a special behavior when set to 'off'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
