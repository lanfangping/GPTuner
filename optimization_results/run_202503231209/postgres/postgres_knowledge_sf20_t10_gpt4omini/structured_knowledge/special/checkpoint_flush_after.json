{"think_procedure": "The knob 'checkpoint_flush_after' in PostgreSQL controls the number of bytes written to the WAL (Write Ahead Log) before a checkpoint flush occurs. It is a numerical setting that typically has a natural order, where higher values indicate more data can be written before a flush. However, it does not have special values like -1 or 0 that would alter its behavior significantly. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob without any special functionality associated with specific values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
