The 'bgwriter_flush_after' knob in PostgreSQL attempts to force the OS to issue writes to the underlying storage when more than a specified amount of data has been written by the background writer, which can reduce transaction latency but may degrade performance in some cases; the value ranges from 0 (disabling forced writeback) to 2MB, with a default of 512kB on Linux and 0 elsewhere, and can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.
