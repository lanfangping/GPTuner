The 'max_locks_per_transaction' knob controls the average number of object locks per transaction, calculated as max_locks_per_transaction * (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions), with a default value of 64, and can only be set at server start. It does not limit the number of rows that can be locked, and may need to be increased for queries involving many tables. On a standby server, it must be set to the same or higher value than on the master server.
