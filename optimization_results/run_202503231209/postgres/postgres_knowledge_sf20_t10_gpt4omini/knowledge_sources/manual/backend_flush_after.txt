The 'backend_flush_after' knob triggers the OS to issue writes to the underlying storage after a single backend has written more than a specified amount of data, ranging from 0 (disabling forced writeback) to 2MB (default is 0), potentially reducing transaction latency but possibly degrading performance for certain workloads.
