The 'join_collapse_limit' knob in the planner rewrites explicit JOIN constructs into lists of FROM items when the list has no more than the set limit of items, with smaller values reducing planning time but potentially leading to inferior query plans; by default, it is set the same as from_collapse_limit, but setting it to 1 prevents reordering of explicit JOINs, allowing advanced users to specify the join order.
