To set the `autovacuum_freeze_max_age` parameter in PostgreSQL, configure it to a value that is higher than the default (200 million transactions) to accommodate your workload, typically setting it to 1 billion (1,000,000,000) for large databases to prevent excessive freezing without impacting performance.
