To set the `effective_cache_size` in PostgreSQL, a good rule of thumb is to configure it to approximately 50-75% of the total system RAM available for caches, typically around 4 GB for systems with 8-16 GB of RAM, or around 16 GB for systems with 32-64 GB of RAM, depending on your workload and usage patterns.
