To set the `max_wal_size` parameter in PostgreSQL, start with a value between 1GB and 2GB for small to medium databases, and consider increasing it to 4GB or more for larger databases, adjusting based on your workload and available disk space to optimize write performance while preventing excessive WAL file accumulation.
