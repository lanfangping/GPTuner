To set the `enable_parallel_hash` parameter in PostgreSQL for parallel hash joins, you can adjust its value to `on` to enable parallel execution, typically with a recommended configuration for systems with multiple CPUs, such as setting it to `on` for systems with 4 or more cores to enhance performance during hash join operations.
