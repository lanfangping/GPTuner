The `checkpoint_completion_target` setting in PostgreSQL should typically be set between 0.5 and 0.9, with a recommended starting value of 0.7, which represents a fraction of the checkpoint interval (specified by `checkpoint_timeout`), helping to spread the I/O load of writing WAL files over time for better performance.
