To optimize performance in PostgreSQL, set the `enable_indexscan` knob to `on` to allow the planner to use index scans when feasible; this is typically left enabled by default with a value of `on` (1), but can be set to `off` (0) in specific scenarios where you want to disable index scans for performance testing or tuning.
