To set the 'work_mem' value in PostgreSQL, a common guideline is to start with 4MB per concurrent session and adjust it based on workload, monitoring performance, and memory availability, with a typical range from 1MB to 64MB for most applications, while considering the total available memory and the number of concurrent connections.
