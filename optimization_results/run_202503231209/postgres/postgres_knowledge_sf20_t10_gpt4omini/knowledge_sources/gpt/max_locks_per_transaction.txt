To set the `max_locks_per_transaction` value in PostgreSQL, start with the default value of 64 and adjust it based on your application's needs; for instance, increase it to 128 or 256 if you anticipate a high number of simultaneous locks per transaction or manage complex queries involving many rows or tables.
