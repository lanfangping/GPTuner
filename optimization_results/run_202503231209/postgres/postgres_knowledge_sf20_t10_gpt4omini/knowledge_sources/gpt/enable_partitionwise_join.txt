To optimize the performance of partitioned tables in PostgreSQL, set the knob `enable_partitionwise_join` to `on` by executing the SQL command `SET enable_partitionwise_join = on;` or by adding `enable_partitionwise_join = on` to the `postgresql.conf` file and restarting the server, especially when dealing with large partitions and complex queries that benefit from this optimization.
