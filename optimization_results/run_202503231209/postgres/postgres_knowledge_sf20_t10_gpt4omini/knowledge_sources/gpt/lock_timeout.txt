To set the 'lock_timeout' in PostgreSQL, configure it to a value that balances performance and contention, typically starting with a value of 100 milliseconds (0.1 seconds), and adjust based on observed wait times and application requirements, ensuring it does not exceed a few seconds to prevent long wait scenarios.
