To set the 'synchronous_commit' parameter in PostgreSQL for optimal performance, you can use the following values: set it to 'on' for maximum durability with possibly higher latency, 'off' for the lowest latency at the risk of losing recent transactions in a crash, or 'remote_apply' for balance, which commits transactions immediately on the primary but waits for acknowledgment from replicas; using 'on' is advisable for critical systems, while 'off' may be acceptable for less important applications.
