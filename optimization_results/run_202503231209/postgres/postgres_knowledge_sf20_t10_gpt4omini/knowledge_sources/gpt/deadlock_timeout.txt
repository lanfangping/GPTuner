To set the `deadlock_timeout` in PostgreSQL, configure its value in milliseconds to a range between 1 ms and 1000 ms, with a typical default of 1 second (1000 ms), adjusting it lower to reduce the time taken to detect deadlocks in high-concurrency environments while balancing the performance impact of frequent checks.
