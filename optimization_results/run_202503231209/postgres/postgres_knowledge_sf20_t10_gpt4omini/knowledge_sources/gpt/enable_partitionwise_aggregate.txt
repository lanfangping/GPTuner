To optimize performance using the `enable_partitionwise_aggregate` knob in PostgreSQL, set its value to `ON` (i.e., `SET enable_partitionwise_aggregate = ON;`) when executing queries that involve partitioned tables, especially if you have a significant number of partitions or expect to aggregate large datasets, as this allows the system to perform aggregations at the partition level, which can improve query efficiency.
