To set the `wal_compression` parameter in PostgreSQL, you should enable it by setting the value to `on` in your `postgresql.conf` file, as it can help reduce the size of WAL files, particularly beneficial in environments with high write loads; however, keep in mind that enabling WAL compression might slightly increase CPU usage, so monitor system performance accordingly.
