Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'max_logical_replication_workers' knob in Postgres according to the number of logical replication subscriptions. This knob sets the maximum number of logical replication workers, including apply workers and table synchronization workers, taken from the pool defined by max_worker_processes. The default value is 4, but it can be increased if there are more subscriptions. However, be aware that each additional worker will consume more system resources.
