As a suggestion, consider adjusting the 'seq_page_cost' knob in Postgres, which is a planner's estimate of the cost of a disk page fetch in a series of sequential fetches. Its default value is 1.0, but it can be specifically adjusted for tables and indexes in a particular tablespace. This adjustment might be necessary if your disk's speed significantly differs from your CPU's speed.
