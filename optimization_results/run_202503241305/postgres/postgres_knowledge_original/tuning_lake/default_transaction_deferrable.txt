I suggest you utilize the 'default_transaction_deferrable' knob to manage the default deferrable status of new transactions. This is particularly useful for delaying deferrable read-only SQL transactions at the serializable isolation level, which can be beneficial for long-running read-only transactions. However, please note that this knob does not affect read-write transactions or those at lower isolation levels. The default setting for this feature is off.
