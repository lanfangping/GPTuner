The 'old_snapshot_threshold' knob in Postgres sets the minimum duration a query snapshot can be used without risk of a 'snapshot too old' error. This allows data that has been dead for longer than this threshold to be vacuumed away, preventing bloat from long-lasting snapshots. The default value disables the feature and sets the snapshot age limit to infinity, and it can only be set at server start. Useful values typically range from a few hours to a few days, with extreme settings potentially leading to bloat or transaction ID wraparound. However, this setting does not guarantee an error will be generated under certain circumstances and does not affect tables that cannot be safely vacuumed early, like system catalogs. It's important to strike a careful balance to avoid performance issues.
