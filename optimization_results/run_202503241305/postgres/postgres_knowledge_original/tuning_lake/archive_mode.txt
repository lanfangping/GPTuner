Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to enable the 'archive_mode' knob in Postgres, which sends completed WAL segments to archive storage by setting the 'archive_command'. There are two modes available, one of which enables the WAL archiver during archive recovery or standby mode, archiving all files restored from the archive or streamed with streaming replication. This setting is typically enabled for systems requiring point-in-time recovery and is recommended in any environment that requires backups and data consistency. However, it can be left disabled for databases which are not the source of truth or which are used just for testing purposes, to minimize the storage used. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start and cannot be enabled when 'wal_level' is set to minimal to avoid unnecessary database restarts.
