As a suggestion, you should be aware that the 'temp_file_limit' knob in PostgreSQL defines the maximum disk space a process can use for temporary files such as sort and hash temporary files. This value is measured in kilobytes if no units are specified. If this limit is exceeded, the transaction will be cancelled. Please note that only superusers have the authority to modify this setting.
