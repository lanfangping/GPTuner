Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'max_pred_locks_per_relation' knob in Postgres according to your needs. This knob controls the limit of pages or tuples of a single relation that can be predicate-locked before the lock is promoted to cover the whole relation. Values greater than or equal to zero indicate an absolute limit, and negative values indicate the division of max_pred_locks_per_transaction by the absolute value of this setting, with the default set at -2. Keep in mind that each lock consumes 64 bytes of shared memory, so it can be increased if a larger number of locks are needed.
