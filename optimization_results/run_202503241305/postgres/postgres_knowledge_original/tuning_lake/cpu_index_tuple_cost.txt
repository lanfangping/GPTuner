The 'cpu_index_tuple_cost' in Postgres is a parameter that is used to adjust the planner's estimated cost of processing each index entry during an index scan. The default value is set at 0.005. This value can be modified based on your system's performance, but it is advisable to keep it lower than 'cpu_tuple_cost' to reflect the fact that index scans are usually faster than sequential scans.
