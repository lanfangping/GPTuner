Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to use the 'trace_recovery_messages' knob in Postgres for logging recovery-related debugging output. This knob primarily aids in debugging Hot Standby and overrides the normal setting of log_min_messages for specific messages. The default setting for this knob is 'log', which doesn't influence logging decisions. It is important to note that this knob can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. The knob is set by specifying a string value that corresponds to the desired debug level, such as 'debug5', 'debug4', 'debug3', 'debug2', 'debug1', or 'log'.
