Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to utilize the 'quote_all_identifiers' knob in Postgres. This feature forces all identifiers to be quoted in the SQL generated by the database. This impacts the output of EXPLAIN and functions like pg_get_viewdef. It is also associated with the --quote-all-identifiers option of app-pgdump and app-pg-dumpall. The knob can be set to either 'on' or 'off', where 'on' enforces the quoting of all identifiers, and 'off' allows unquoted identifiers.
