As a suggestion, you can utilize the 'log_temp_files' knob in Postgres to control the logging of temporary file names and sizes. This feature logs an entry for each file when deleted. You can set it to a specific size in kilobytes, and any temporary file larger than this size will have its details logged. This is particularly useful for detecting excessive usage of temporary files, which may indicate low work_mem or maintenance_work_mem. Please note that a certain setting can disable logging and this setting is only changeable by superusers.
