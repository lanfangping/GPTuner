The 'min_parallel_index_scan_size' in Postgres is a setting that determines the minimum amount of index data required for a parallel scan to be considered. This does not necessarily involve scanning the entire index, but rather the pages believed to be touched by the scan. This setting is particularly important in determining whether an index can participate in a parallel vacuum. The default value for this setting is 512 kilobytes (512kB), but it can be adjusted based on the specific workload and system resources.
