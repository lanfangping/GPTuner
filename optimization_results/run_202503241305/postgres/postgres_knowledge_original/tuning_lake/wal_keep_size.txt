I suggest adjusting the 'wal_keep_size' knob in Postgres, which determines the minimum size of past log file segments, in megabytes, to be retained in the pg_wal directory for streaming replication. This is particularly important for standby servers. The default value is zero, meaning no extra segments are kept for standby purposes. However, it's recommended to set it to a value large enough based on the expected volume of data changes between base backups. This ensures that necessary WAL files for the standby are not removed.
