Based on the manual suggestion, it is recommended to adjust the 'backend_flush_after' knob to control the OS's issuance of writes to the underlying storage after a single backend has written a certain amount of data. Setting this to 0 will disable forced writeback, which could potentially decrease transaction latency. However, be aware that this might also degrade performance for specific workloads.
