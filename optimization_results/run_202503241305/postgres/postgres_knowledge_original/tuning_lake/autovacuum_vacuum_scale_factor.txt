Suggestion: Consider adjusting the 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' parameter in the postgresql.conf file or server command line. This knob determines if a VACUUM should be triggered by adding a fraction of the table size to the autovacuum_vacuum_threshold. By default, it is set at 0.2 or 20% of the table size. However, this setting can also be overridden for individual tables if needed.
