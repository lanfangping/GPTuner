Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'jit_above_cost' knob in Postgres according to your system's workload and performance needs. This knob activates the JIT compiler for queries that exceed a set cost, potentially speeding up query execution despite increasing planning time. The default value is 100000, but you can increase or decrease this value as needed. However, be cautious not to set it too low as it may cause the JIT compiler to be used excessively, potentially slowing down your system. If you wish to disable JIT compilation, you can set the value to -1.
