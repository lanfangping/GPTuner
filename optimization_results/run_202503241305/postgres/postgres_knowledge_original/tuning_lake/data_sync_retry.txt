As a suggestion, consider adjusting the 'data_sync_retry' knob in PostgreSQL. By default, it is set to 'off', which can cause a PANIC-level error and crash the server if there's a failure in flushing modified data files to the system. However, if you set it to 'on', the system will report an error and continue running, allowing for a retry at a later checkpoint. Before making this change, it's crucial to investigate how your operating system handles buffered data in the event of a write-back failure.
