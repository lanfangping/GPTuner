The 'jit' knob in PostgreSQL allows the use of Just-In-Time compilation, which is enabled by default. This can be set by modifying the 'jit' configuration parameter in the postgresql.conf file or by using the SET command in an SQL query. However, you may want to disable it for OLTP systems with simple queries.
