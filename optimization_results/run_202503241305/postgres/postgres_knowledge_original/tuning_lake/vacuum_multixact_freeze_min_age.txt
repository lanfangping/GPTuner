Suggestion: Consider adjusting the 'vacuum_multixact_freeze_min_age' setting in VACUUM, which determines the cutoff age for replacing multixact IDs with a newer ID during a table scan. By default, this is set at 5 million multixacts. However, be aware that this value is effectively limited to half of 'autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age' to prevent overly frequent forced autovacuums.
