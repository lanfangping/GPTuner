Based on the suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'checkpoint_timeout' knob in PostgreSQL depending on your workload and recovery needs. A higher value will reduce the frequency of checkpoints, potentially smoothing out I/O spikes and improving I/O usage, but it may increase the recovery time after a database crash. Conversely, a lower value will increase the frequency of checkpoints, which could create more I/O in aggregation and potentially impact performance. However, it may reduce the potential for data loss. Please consider these trade-offs carefully when tuning this parameter.
