As a suggestion, superusers should adjust the 'log_connections' knob at the start of each session to log each attempted and successfully authenticated connection to the server. This feature is particularly useful for understanding line-rate information about session establishment. However, it's important to note that the default setting is off and duplicate connection messages may not necessarily indicate an issue, as some client programs, like psql, attempt to connect twice to determine password requirements. If you're dealing with a large number of connections and not using connection pooling, consider setting up connection pooling to manage them effectively.
