The 'max_files_per_process' knob in Postgres sets the limit for open files per server subprocess, defaulting to one thousand files. It controls the maximum number of simultaneously open files for each server process and should be adjusted based on your system's file descriptor limit. If 'Too many open files' failures occur, consider reducing this limit. Please note that this setting can only be adjusted at server start.
