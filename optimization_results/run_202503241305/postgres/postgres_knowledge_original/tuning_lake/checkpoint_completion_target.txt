The 'checkpoint_completion_target' knob in PostgreSQL is used to set the goal for checkpoint completion as a percentage of the total time between checkpoints. This is a floating point number that can only be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. While the default setting is 0.5, it is recommended to aim for a completion within 90% of the checkpoint timeout period.
