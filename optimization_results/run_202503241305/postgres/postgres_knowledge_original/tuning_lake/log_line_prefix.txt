Suggestion: To enrich your log information, you can set the 'log_line_prefix' knob in Postgres. This is a printf-style string that is output at the start of each log line, with % characters beginning escape sequences replaced with status information. It can be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line, with the default being '%m [%p] ' which logs a time stamp and the process ID. You can provide a string value that includes special escape characters, such as '%m' for timestamp, '%u' for username, '%d' for database name, etc., to customize the format of the log line prefix. For instance, 'log_line_prefix = '%m [%p] %q%u@%d ' would result in log lines like '2005-01-10 10:20:30 [535] dbuser@dbname statement: SELECT * FROM users;'. If you plan to use external log processing tools like PgBadger, ensure to check the documentation to use a compatible ‘log_line_prefix’.
