The 'effective_io_concurrency' knob in PostgreSQL should be set to a value that matches the number of concurrent disk I/O operations your storage system can perform. This setting primarily affects bitmap heap scans and its optimal value is dependent on the type of storage used, the database workload, and the operating system's support for the posix_fadvise function. For instance, SSDs are often set around 100-200 and traditional HDDs around 1-10.
