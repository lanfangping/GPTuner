I suggest adjusting the 'max_standby_archive_delay' setting in Hot Standby, which determines the length of time the standby server will wait before cancelling any standby queries that conflict with incoming WAL entries, particularly when WAL data is read from the WAL archive. This setting is measured in milliseconds and is set to default at 30 seconds. Please note that this setting only applies to the total time allowed for the application of data from any one WAL segment, and not the run time of individual queries.
