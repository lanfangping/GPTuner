Based on the suggestions, it is recommended to control the request for huge pages for the main shared memory area using the 'huge_pages' knob. The valid values for this setting are 'try' (default), 'on', and 'off'. This feature is currently supported only on Linux and Windows and can lead to smaller page tables and less CPU time spent on memory management, thus increasing performance. However, if you are not fully aware of what you are doing, it is suggested to set it to 'off'. If you are confident in your understanding, you can set it to 'on' and configure sysctl appropriately.
