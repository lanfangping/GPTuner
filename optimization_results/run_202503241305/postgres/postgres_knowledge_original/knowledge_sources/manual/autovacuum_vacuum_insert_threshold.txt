The 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' knob triggers a VACUUM operation in a table after a specified number of tuples have been inserted, with the default set at 1000 tuples, and can be deactivated by setting it to -1; this parameter is set in the postgresql.conf file or server command line, but can be adjusted for individual tables by modifying table storage parameters.
