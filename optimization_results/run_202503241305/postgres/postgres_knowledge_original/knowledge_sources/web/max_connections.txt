For most use cases, you should use connection pooling. When using connection pooling in transaction mode, set this parameter as a low multiple (2-5x) of the number of cores on the server. If running on session mode, to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued. If not using connection pooling, to the required number of concurrent users. Performance may be suboptimal.
