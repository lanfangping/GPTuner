The 'temp_buffers' knob in Postgres is set in units of 8KB blocks and determines the maximum amount of memory used for temporary buffers by each database session; the default value is 8MB, but it can be increased if a session is executing complex queries that involve many temporary tables, but remember that this memory is not shared among sessions.
