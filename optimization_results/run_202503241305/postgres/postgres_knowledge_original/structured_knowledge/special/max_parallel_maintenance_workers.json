{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers' sets the maximum number of parallel workers that can be started by a single utility command. It is mentioned in the description that setting this value to 0 disables the use of parallel workers by utility commands. This indicates that the knob has a special value that changes its function, which is a characteristic of a 'special' knob. Therefore, the knob 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers' is a 'special' knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
