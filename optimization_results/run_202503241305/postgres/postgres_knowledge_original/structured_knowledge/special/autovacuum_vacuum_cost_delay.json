{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. I noticed that it mentions a special value, -1, which changes the function of the knob. Instead of setting a specific delay for automatic VACUUM operations, it uses the regular vacuum_cost_delay value. This breaks the natural order of the knob, as it doesn't simply set a delay in milliseconds. Therefore, this knob can be classified as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
