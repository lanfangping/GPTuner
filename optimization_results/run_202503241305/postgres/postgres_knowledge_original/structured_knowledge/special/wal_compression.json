{"think_procedure": "First, we look at the description of the knob. The knob 'wal_compression' is a parameter that can be turned on or off. It does not mention any special numerical values that would change the function of the knob, such as -1 or 0. Therefore, it does not seem to be a 'special' numerical knob. It behaves like a regular on/off switch, where 'on' enables the feature and 'off' disables it.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
