{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'cursor_tuple_fraction' is a numerical knob that sets the planner's estimate of the fraction of a cursor's rows that will be retrieved. The description mentions that the default is 0.1 and the maximum setting is 1.0. It also explains the effect of smaller and larger values on the planner's behavior. However, there is no mention of any special values that would cause the knob to perform a very different function or disable a feature. Therefore, this knob does not seem to be a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
