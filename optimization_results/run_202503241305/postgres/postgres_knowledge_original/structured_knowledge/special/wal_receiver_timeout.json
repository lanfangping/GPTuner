{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'wal_receiver_timeout' is related to terminating replication connections that are inactive for a certain amount of time. It is mentioned that a value of zero disables the timeout mechanism. This indicates that the knob has a special value that changes its function, which is a characteristic of a 'special' knob.
