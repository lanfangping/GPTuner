{"think_procedure": "The description of the knob 'parallel_leader_participation' does not mention any special numerical values that would change the function of the knob. It only mentions that the default setting is 'on' and that setting it to 'off' changes the behavior of the leader process. This suggests that the knob is a binary switch rather than a numerical knob with a special value. Therefore, it is not a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
