{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'maintenance_io_concurrency' is used for maintenance work that is done on behalf of many client sessions. The default value is 10 on supported systems, otherwise 0. This value can be overridden for tables in a particular tablespace by setting the tablespace parameter of the same name. There is no mention of any special value that would change the function of the knob drastically, such as disabling a feature. Therefore, it is not a 'special' knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
