{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'enable_indexonlyscan' is described as enabling or disabling a feature, which suggests it might be a binary or boolean type of knob, typically taking values like 0 or 1, true or false. However, the description does not mention any special values that would break the natural order of the knob, such as -1 or 0 performing a very different function compared to its regular operation. Therefore, I conclude that this is not a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
