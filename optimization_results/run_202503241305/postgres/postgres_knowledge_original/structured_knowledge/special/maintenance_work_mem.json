{"think_procedure": "The description of the knob 'maintenance_work_mem' does not mention any special values that would change the function of the knob. The knob is used to specify the maximum amount of memory to be used by maintenance operations. It defaults to 64 megabytes (64MB) and can be set larger than work_mem. The description also mentions that when autovacuum runs, up to autovacuum_max_workers times this memory may be allocated, so care should be taken not to set the default value too high. However, there is no mention of any special values such as -1 or 0 that would disable a feature or change the function of the knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
