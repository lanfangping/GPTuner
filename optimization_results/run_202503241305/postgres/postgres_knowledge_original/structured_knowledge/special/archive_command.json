{"think_procedure": "First, we read the description of the knob. The knob 'archive_command' is a command that is executed to archive a completed WAL file segment. It has a special behavior when it is set to an empty string, which temporarily disables WAL archiving. Also, setting it to a command that does nothing but return true, effectively disables archiving. Therefore, this knob can be classified as a 'special knob' as it has special values (empty string and a command that returns true) that change its behavior significantly.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": ["", "/bin/true (REM on Windows)"]}
