{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'max_parallel_workers' sets the maximum number of workers that the system can support for parallel operations. The default value is 8. There is no mention of any special values such as -1 or 0 that would change the function of this knob. Therefore, it seems to behave like a regular numerical knob, where the value simply sets the maximum number of parallel workers. There is no indication that a special value would disable a feature or change the function of this knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
