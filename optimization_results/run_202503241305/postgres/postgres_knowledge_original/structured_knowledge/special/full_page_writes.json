{"think_procedure": "The description of the knob 'full_page_writes' indicates that it is a parameter that can be turned on or off. It does not mention any special numerical values that would break the natural order of operation. Instead, it describes the function of the knob when it is turned on and off. Therefore, it does not seem to be a 'special' numerical knob with special values such as -1 or 0 that perform a very different function compared to its regular operation.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
