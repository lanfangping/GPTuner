{"think_procedure": "First, we read the description of the knob. The knob 'log_temp_files' controls the logging of temporary file names and sizes. It is mentioned that a value of zero logs all temporary file information, while positive values log only files whose size is greater than or equal to the specified amount of data. However, the default setting is -1, which disables such logging. This indicates that the knob has a special value (-1) that changes its regular operation, thus making it a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
