The `wal_receiver_status_interval` parameter sets the maximum interval (default: 10 seconds) for the WAL receiver process on a standby to send replication progress updates (write, flush, and apply positions) to the primary or upstream standby, with updates sent immediately on position changes or at least as often as specified; setting it to zero disables updates entirely.
