The `log_autovacuum_min_duration` parameter logs autovacuum actions that run for at least the specified time (e.g., 250ms), with a default of -1 (disabling logging), 0 logging all actions, and any non-negative value enabling logging for actions exceeding that duration, while also logging skipped actions due to locks or dropped relations.
