The `constraint_exclusion` parameter controls the query planner's use of table constraints to optimize queries, with default setting `partition` (examining constraints only for inheritance child tables and UNION ALL subqueries), `on` (examining constraints for all tables, adding noticeable planning overhead), and `off` (never examining constraints), often improving performance in partitioned tables by avoiding unnecessary scans, such as skipping `child1000` when querying `key = 2400` in an inheritance tree.
