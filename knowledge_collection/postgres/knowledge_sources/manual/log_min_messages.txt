The `log_min_messages` knob controls the minimum message level written to the server log, with valid levels ranging from DEBUG5 (most verbose) to PANIC (most critical), where each level includes all subsequent levels; the default is WARNING, meaning only messages of WARNING, ERROR, LOG, FATAL, and PANIC are logged.
