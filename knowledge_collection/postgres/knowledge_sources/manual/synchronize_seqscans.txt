The 'synchronize_seqscans' knob, when enabled (default: on), allows concurrent sequential scans of large tables to synchronize and read the same block at approximately the same time, sharing I/O workload, but may cause unpredictable row ordering in queries without an ORDER BY clause; disabling it reverts to pre-8.3 behavior, ensuring scans always start from the beginning of the table.
