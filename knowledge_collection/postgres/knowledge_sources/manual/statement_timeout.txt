The `statement_timeout` knob aborts any SQL statement that exceeds the specified time limit, measured in milliseconds (default is 0, disabling the timeout), with the timeout applied separately to each statement in a multi-statement query (PostgreSQL 13+), and optionally logs the timeout if `log_min_error_statement` is set to ERROR or lower.
