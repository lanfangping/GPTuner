Set the `log_disconnections` knob in PostgreSQL to `on` to log client disconnections, which is useful for auditing and troubleshooting, or to `off` to reduce log volume if such details are unnecessary. For example, set it to `on` in environments requiring detailed session tracking or to `off` in high-throughput systems where logging every disconnection could overwhelm the log files.
