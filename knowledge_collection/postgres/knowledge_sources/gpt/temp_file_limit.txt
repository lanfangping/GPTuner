Set the `temp_file_limit` knob in PostgreSQL based on your system's available disk space and workload requirements, typically ranging from **1GB to 10GB** for moderate workloads, but adjust it higher (e.g., **50GB to 100GB**) for systems with large temporary file usage or lower (e.g., **100MB to 1GB**) for disk-constrained environments to prevent excessive disk consumption.
