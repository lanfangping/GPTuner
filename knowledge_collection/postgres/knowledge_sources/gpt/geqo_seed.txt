The `geqo_seed` knob in PostgreSQL, which controls the seed for the Genetic Query Optimizer (GEQO) algorithm, should be set to a random integer between 0 and 2147483647 (inclusive) to ensure diverse query plan generation, with a common practice being to use a value like `42` for reproducibility or a dynamically generated random number for varied optimization outcomes.
