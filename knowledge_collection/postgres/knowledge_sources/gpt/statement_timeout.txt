Set the `statement_timeout` knob in PostgreSQL to a value (e.g., 30s, 1m, or 5m) based on the expected query execution time, ensuring it balances between preventing long-running queries and allowing sufficient time for complex operations, typically starting with 30 seconds for general workloads and adjusting as needed.
