Set the 'synchronous_commit' knob in PostgreSQL to 'on' for full transaction durability, 'off' for better performance at the risk of losing transactions during a crash, or use other values like 'local', 'remote_write', or 'remote_apply' to control the behavior with respect to synchronous replication with specific guarantees, if you have additional synchronous standbys configured.
