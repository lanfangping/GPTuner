The `array_nulls` knob in PostgreSQL controls whether array elements set to `NULL` are treated as actual `NULL` values; set it to `on` (default) to enable `NULL` handling in arrays, or `off` to treat `NULL` as an empty string, with `on` being recommended for strict SQL compliance and `off` for backward compatibility with older PostgreSQL versions.
