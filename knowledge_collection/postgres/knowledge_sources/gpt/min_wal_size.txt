To optimize the 'min_wal_size' setting in PostgreSQL, adjust the value based on your system's workload, with typical recommendations starting around 80MB for smaller systems and scaling upwards based on transactional volume and database size, going as high as 2-4GB for heavy workloads to ensure efficient WAL file handling and recycling.
