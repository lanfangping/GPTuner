Set the `min_parallel_table_scan_size` knob in PostgreSQL based on your workload and hardware: for small tables or low-concurrency environments, use a value like **8MB** to encourage parallelism, while for large tables or high-concurrency systems, increase it to **32MB** or higher to reduce overhead and avoid excessive parallel workers. Adjust iteratively while monitoring query performance and system load.
