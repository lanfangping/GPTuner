Set the `max_worker_processes` value in PostgreSQL based on the number of CPU cores available, typically equal to the number of cores (e.g., 8 for an 8-core system), but ensure it aligns with your workload and does not exceed the system's memory capacity, as each worker process consumes additional resources.
