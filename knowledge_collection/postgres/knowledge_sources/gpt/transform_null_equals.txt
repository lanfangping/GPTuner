The `transform_null_equals` knob in PostgreSQL, when set to `true` (or `on`), treats `expr = NULL` as `expr IS NULL`, enabling compatibility with SQL standards; set it to `false` (or `off`) to maintain backward compatibility with older PostgreSQL behavior where `expr = NULL` evaluates to `NULL`. For example, use `SET transform_null_equals = on;` to enable standard behavior or `SET transform_null_equals = off;` to revert to legacy behavior.
