Set the `parallel_setup_cost` knob in PostgreSQL to a value between **100** and **1000** (default is 1000) based on the system's parallel query performance, where lower values encourage more parallel plans for queries with shorter execution times, and higher values reduce parallelism for queries with high setup overhead. Adjust incrementally while monitoring query performance to find the optimal balance.
