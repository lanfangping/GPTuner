To optimally set the 'enable_indexscan' knob in PostgreSQL, you should typically set it to 'on' (true) which allows the planner to use index scan methods; however, you can disable it by setting it to 'off' (false) to avoid index scans during testing or in specific use cases where sequential scans are more efficient.
