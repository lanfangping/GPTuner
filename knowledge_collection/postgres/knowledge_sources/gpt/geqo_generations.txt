Set the `geqo_generations` knob in PostgreSQL to a value between 100 and 1000, with higher values (e.g., 500-1000) recommended for complex queries involving many joins to improve the quality of the genetic algorithm's query plan, while lower values (e.g., 100-200) can be used for simpler queries to reduce optimization time.
