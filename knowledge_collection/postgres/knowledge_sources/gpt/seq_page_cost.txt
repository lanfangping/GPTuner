To optimally set the 'seq_page_cost' knob in PostgreSQL, it's generally advised to configure it to a lower value such as 1.0 in environments where sequential disk I/O is fast (e.g., SSDs), but increase it relative to 'random_page_cost' (potentially higher than the default of 1.0) in setups with slower sequential access to accurately reflect the actual cost difference between sequential and random I/O.
