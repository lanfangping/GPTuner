Set the `seq_page_cost` knob in PostgreSQL based on your storage performance: for fast SSDs, a value between **1.0 and 2.0** is typical; for slower HDDs, values around **4.0** are more appropriate, as it reflects the higher cost of sequential page reads compared to CPU operations. Adjust within this range while benchmarking query performance to find the optimal value for your workload.
