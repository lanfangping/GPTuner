The `checkpoint_segments` knob in PostgreSQL, which has been replaced by `max_wal_size` in newer versions, should be set based on the desired checkpoint frequency and recovery time; for example, a value of 32 (default in older versions) corresponds to approximately 512MB of WAL files, while increasing it to 64 (1GB of WAL) can reduce checkpoint frequency but may increase recovery time after a crash.
