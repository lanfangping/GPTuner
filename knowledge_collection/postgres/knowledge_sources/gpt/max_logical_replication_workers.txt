Set the value of `max_logical_replication_workers` based on the number of logical replication slots and the expected workload, typically starting with a value equal to the number of replication slots plus a small buffer (e.g., 4-8 additional workers for overhead), ensuring it does not exceed the available system resources like CPU and memory. For example, if you have 5 replication slots, start with a value of 10 and adjust based on performance monitoring.
