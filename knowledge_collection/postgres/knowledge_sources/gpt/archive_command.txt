Set the `archive_command` knob in PostgreSQL to a command that copies WAL files to a designated archive location, such as `cp %p /path/to/archive/%f`, ensuring the command returns a zero exit status on success and uses `%p` for the file path and `%f` for the file name, with the archive location having sufficient storage (e.g., 1.5x the size of your WAL segment size multiplied by the expected number of segments during the retention period).
