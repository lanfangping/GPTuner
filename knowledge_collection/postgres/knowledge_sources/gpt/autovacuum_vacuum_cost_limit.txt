To optimally set the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' value in PostgreSQL, consider assigning a value between 200 and 2000, based on your workload, where higher settings can benefit systems with bulk data operations, and adjust it in line with `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` to balance maintenance overhead with database performance.
