To optimally set the 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' in Postgres, it is commonly recommended to configure it to a value between 0.01 (1%) and 0.1 (10%), adjusting lower to increase the frequency of analyze operations for rapidly changing tables or higher for more stable tables, based on the specific workload and table size variances of your database.
