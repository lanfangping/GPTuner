Set the `log_min_duration_statement` knob in PostgreSQL to a value (in milliseconds) that captures slow queries relevant to your performance goals, such as 100ms for general applications, 10ms for high-performance systems, or 1000ms for debugging, ensuring it aligns with your query latency thresholds and monitoring needs.
