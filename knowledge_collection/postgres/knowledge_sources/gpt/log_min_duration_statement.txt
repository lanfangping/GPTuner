To optimally set the 'log_min_duration_statement' knob in PostgreSQL, configure the value (in milliseconds) based on your performance monitoring needs; commonly used thresholds include 0 for logging all statements, 250ms, 1000ms (1 second), or even higher if you wish to log only longer-running queries to minimize log volume.
