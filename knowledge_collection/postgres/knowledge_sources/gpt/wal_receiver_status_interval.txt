Set the `wal_receiver_status_interval` knob in PostgreSQL to a value between **1 second (1000 ms)** and **10 seconds (10000 ms)**, balancing between reducing replication lag (lower values) and minimizing network overhead (higher values), with a default of **10 seconds** being suitable for most use cases.
