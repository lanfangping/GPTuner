The `DEFAULT` knob in PostgreSQL is typically set to a value that balances performance and resource usage, often starting with `1` for a single CPU core, but can be adjusted based on the number of available CPU cores (e.g., `4` for a 4-core system) and workload characteristics, with higher values improving parallelism for complex queries but increasing resource consumption.
