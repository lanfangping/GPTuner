To set the value for the `cpu_index_tuple_cost` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on your workload: for OLTP systems with frequent index scans, start with the default value of `0.005`; for OLAP systems with fewer index scans, consider increasing it slightly (e.g., `0.01`) to discourage excessive index usage, or decrease it (e.g., `0.001`) if index scans are underutilized and performance is critical.
