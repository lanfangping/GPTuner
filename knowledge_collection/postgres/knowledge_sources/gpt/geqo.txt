The `geqo` knob in PostgreSQL, which controls the Genetic Query Optimizer, is typically set to a value between 1 (enabled) and 0 (disabled), with the default being 1 for queries involving 12 or more tables; for smaller queries, the traditional planner is used, but you can adjust the threshold by setting `geqo_threshold` (default 12) to a lower or higher number depending on query complexity and performance needs.
