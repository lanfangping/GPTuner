The `geqo` knob in PostgreSQL, which controls the Genetic Query Optimizer, is typically set to `on` (default) for queries with many joins (e.g., 12 or more tables) to improve optimization performance, but can be set to `off` for simpler queries or when deterministic planning is preferred. Adjust `geqo_threshold` (default: 12) to control the number of joins at which GEQO is activated.
