The `geqo_pool_size` knob in PostgreSQL, which controls the population size for the Genetic Query Optimizer (GEQO), should typically be set to a value between 100 and 1000, with a default of 100; for larger or more complex queries, increasing it to 200-500 can improve optimization quality, but higher values may lead to diminishing returns and increased planning time.
