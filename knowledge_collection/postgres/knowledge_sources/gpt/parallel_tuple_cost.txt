To set the value for the `parallel_tuple_cost` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on the overhead of transferring tuples between parallel workers, typically starting with a default of **0.1** and increasing it (e.g., to **0.2** or higher) if parallel queries are slower than expected, or decreasing it (e.g., to **0.05**) if the system is underutilizing parallelism due to high perceived costs.
