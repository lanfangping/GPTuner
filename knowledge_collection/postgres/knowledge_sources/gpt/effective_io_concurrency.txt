Set the `effective_io_concurrency` knob in PostgreSQL to a value between 1 and 10, depending on the number of independent disk subsystems or SSDs available, with higher values (e.g., 5-10) for systems with multiple SSDs or high-performance storage arrays, and lower values (e.g., 1-2) for single-disk setups.
