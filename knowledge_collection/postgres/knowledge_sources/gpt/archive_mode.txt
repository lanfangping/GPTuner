Set the `archive_mode` knob in PostgreSQL to `on` to enable WAL archiving, ensuring that completed WAL segments are archived to a specified location, typically using `archive_command`; for example, `archive_command = 'cp %p /path/to/archive/%f'` ensures WAL files are copied to `/path/to/archive/`. If archiving is not needed, set it to `off`. For logical replication setups, use `archive_mode = always` to archive WAL files even when not in recovery or standby mode.
