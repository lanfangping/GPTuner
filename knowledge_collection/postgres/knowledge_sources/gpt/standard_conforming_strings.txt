Set the `standard_conforming_strings` knob in PostgreSQL to `on` (default since version 9.1) to ensure backslashes (`\`) in string literals are treated as escape characters, or to `off` (default in versions before 9.1) to treat backslashes as regular characters, depending on your application's compatibility needs.
