Set the `full_page_writes` knob to `off` in PostgreSQL when using a file system with write-ahead logging (WAL) protection, such as ZFS, to reduce WAL volume and improve performance, but keep it `on` otherwise to ensure data integrity, especially if using older versions (pre-9.x) or less reliable storage systems.
