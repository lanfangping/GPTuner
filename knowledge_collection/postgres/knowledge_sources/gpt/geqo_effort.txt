The `geqo_effort` knob in PostgreSQL, which controls the genetic query optimizer's search effort, should typically be set between 10 and 1000, with higher values (e.g., 500-1000) increasing optimization time but potentially improving query plans for complex joins, while lower values (e.g., 10-100) are suitable for simpler queries to reduce planning overhead.
