Set the `quote_all_identifiers` knob in PostgreSQL to `on` (or `true`) to ensure all identifiers (e.g., table names, column names) are quoted in SQL statements, which is particularly useful when identifiers contain special characters, mixed-case letters, or reserved keywords, or set it to `off` (or `false`) for unquoted identifiers, which is the default behavior for compatibility and simplicity.
