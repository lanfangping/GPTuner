Set the `log_min_error_statement` knob in PostgreSQL to control the logging of SQL statements that cause errors, typically choosing values like `ERROR` (default) to log only errors, `WARNING` to log warnings and above, or `NOTICE` to log more detailed information, depending on the desired verbosity and debugging needs.
