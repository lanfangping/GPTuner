Set the 'enable_bitmapscan' knob in PostgreSQL to 'on' (true) to enable bitmap heap scanning of indexes, typically enhancing query performance by efficiently handling large data sets; however, adjust it to 'off' (false) if specific query patterns or performance metrics suggest bitmap scans degrade the performance, taking into account factors such as available memory and the nature of your queries.
