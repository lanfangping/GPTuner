Set the `max_standby_archive_delay` knob in PostgreSQL to a value (e.g., 30s, 1m, or 5m) that balances the acceptable delay for standby servers to apply WAL segments from the archive with the need to minimize replication lag, ensuring it aligns with your recovery time objectives (RTO) and workload requirements.
