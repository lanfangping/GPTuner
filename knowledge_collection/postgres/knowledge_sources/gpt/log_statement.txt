To set the `log_statement` knob in PostgreSQL, choose one of the following values based on your logging needs: `none` (log nothing), `ddl` (log only data definition statements like CREATE, ALTER, DROP), `mod` (log DDL and data-modifying statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), or `all` (log all statements); for example, set it to `mod` to log both schema changes and data modifications.
