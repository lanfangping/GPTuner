Set the `client_min_messages` knob in PostgreSQL to control the verbosity of messages sent to the client, with common values being `NOTICE` (default, logs important but non-critical messages), `WARNING` (logs warnings and above), or `ERROR` (logs only errors), depending on the desired level of detail for debugging or production environments.
