To set the `log_line_prefix` in PostgreSQL, you can use a format like `'%m [%p] %q%u@%d '` to include the timestamp (`%m`), process ID (`%p`), session line number (`%q`), username (`%u`), and database name (`%d`), ensuring logs are detailed and traceable. Adjust the format based on specific needs, such as adding `%a` for application name or `%h` for host IP.
