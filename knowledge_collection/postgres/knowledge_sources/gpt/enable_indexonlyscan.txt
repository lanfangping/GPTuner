To set the value for the `enable_indexonlyscan` knob in PostgreSQL, you can adjust it using the `SET` command, such as `SET enable_indexonlyscan = true;` to enable index-only scans, or `SET enable_indexonlyscan = false;` to disable them, typically based on performance profiling and specific query patterns, where enabling may improve performance for queries that can benefit from index-only scans, especially in scenarios with frequent reads and minimal updates to indexed columns.
