Set the 'autovacuum_work_mem' value in PostgreSQL based on the workload and available memory; generally, start with settings between 20MB to 50MB, adjusting upwards based on system capacity and the complexity of vacuum operations, but ensure it does not exceed maintenance_work_mem to avoid inefficient memory usage.
