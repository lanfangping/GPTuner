For the 'autovacuum' knob in PostgreSQL, it is typically recommended to enable it by setting 'autovacuum = on', and further adjust its performance through parameters such as 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' (commonly set around 0.2), 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' (often set at 0.1), and specific configuration settings like 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' which can be adjusted according to the system's workload, generally within the range of 20ms to 50ms to balance maintenance tasks with system performance.
