Set the `autovacuum` knob in PostgreSQL by enabling it (`autovacuum = on`) and configuring related parameters like `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` (default 200, can be increased to 1000-2000 for faster vacuuming) and `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` (default 0.2, reduce to 0.05-0.1 for more frequent vacuuming on frequently updated tables), while monitoring table activity and adjusting based on workload and table size.
