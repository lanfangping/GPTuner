For the 'DATABASE' knob in PostgreSQL, set the value based on the size of your dataset and workload: for small databases (up to 1GB), use default settings; for medium databases (1GB-100GB), increase `shared_buffers` to 25% of RAM and `work_mem` to 64MB-256MB; for large databases (100GB+), allocate 40-50% of RAM to `shared_buffers` and adjust `work_mem` to 256MB-1GB, while tuning `maintenance_work_mem` and `checkpoint_timeout` accordingly.
