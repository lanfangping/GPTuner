Set the `log_autovacuum_min_duration` knob to a value (e.g., 1000 milliseconds) that logs autovacuum activities taking longer than this threshold, helping to monitor and optimize long-running vacuum operations without overwhelming the logs with short, frequent tasks. Adjust based on workload and desired logging granularity.
