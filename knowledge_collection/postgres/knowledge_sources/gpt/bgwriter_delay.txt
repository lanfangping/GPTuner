To set the `bgwriter_delay` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on the desired background writer activity: start with the default value of **200ms**, increase it (e.g., to **500ms**) to reduce I/O load if the system is under heavy write pressure, or decrease it (e.g., to **100ms**) to improve write performance if the system has sufficient I/O capacity and frequent checkpoints are causing performance issues.
