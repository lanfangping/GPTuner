Set the `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` to a value between 0.01 and 0.2, depending on the database size and workload, with smaller databases or more frequent updates benefiting from lower values (e.g., 0.01 to 0.05), while larger databases or less frequent updates may use higher values (e.g., 0.1 to 0.2).
