{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'data_sync_retry' has two states, 'on' and 'off'. The default state is 'off'. When it is set to 'off', it raises a PANIC-level error and causes the server to crash. This is a very different function compared to its regular operation when it is set to 'on', where it reports an error but continues to run. Therefore, this knob can be classified as a 'special knob'. The special value in this case is 'off'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
