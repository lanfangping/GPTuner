{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' knob in PostgreSQL is a 'special knob', we need to understand its function and the impact of its settings. This knob controls the cost limit for each autovacuum process, influencing the amount of resources the process can use. The default value is typically a positive integer, indicating a limit on the vacuum cost for autovacuum operations. A crucial aspect is to check if there are any specific values that change the behavior of this knob outside of the typical scale or functionality. Upon reviewing the PostgreSQL documentation, it is noted that setting 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' to -1 allows the system to use the value in 'vacuum_cost_limit' as the limit for autovacuum operations. This special value of -1 changes the behavior from using a specific limit to using a global setting, thus classifying it as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
