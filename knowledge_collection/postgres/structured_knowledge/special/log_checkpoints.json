Check if log_checkpoints has any special values that deviate from its natural order, such as -1 or 0, which might indicate a different functionality. 4. Research or refer to PostgreSQL documentation to confirm if log_checkpoints has special values and what those values signify. 5. Conclude whether log_checkpoints is a 'special knob' based on the presence and functionality of special values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
