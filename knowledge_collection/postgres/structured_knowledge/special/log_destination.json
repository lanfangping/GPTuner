{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: log_destination. 2. Understand the function of log_destination in PostgreSQL, which is used to specify the server log output destinations. 3. Research if log_destination has any special values that alter its behavior significantly from its regular numerical or ordered settings. 4. Determine if setting log_destination to a specific value (e.g., 'none') disables logging or changes its function in a way that breaks the natural order of its settings. 5. Conclude whether log_destination qualifies as a 'special knob' based on the presence of such special values.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "none"}
