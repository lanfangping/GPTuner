{"think_procedure": "First, we read the description of the knob. The knob 'from_collapse_limit' is a numerical knob that controls the number of items in the FROM list of a query. The description mentions that setting this value to 'geqo_threshold' or more may trigger use of the GEQO planner, which can result in non-optimal plans. This indicates that the knob has a special value that changes its behavior, making it a 'special' numerical knob. The special value in this case is 'geqo_threshold'.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": "geqo_threshold"}
