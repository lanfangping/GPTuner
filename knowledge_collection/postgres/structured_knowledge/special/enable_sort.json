{"think_procedure": "The description of the knob 'enable_sort' suggests that it is used to enable or disable a specific feature, which is the query planner's use of explicit sort steps. This indicates that it is not a regular numerical knob that has a natural order. Instead, it behaves differently based on its value, which is a characteristic of a special knob. However, the description does not mention any special values such as -1 or 0 that would perform a different function compared to its regular operation. Therefore, it can be concluded that 'enable_sort' is not a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
