{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: max_standby_streaming_delay. 2. Understand its regular function: it sets the maximum delay before a standby server will stop streaming replication to avoid applying changes that conflict with running queries. 3. Research if this knob has any special values that alter its behavior significantly. 4. Discover that setting max_standby_streaming_delay to -1 disables the delay mechanism entirely, allowing the standby to apply changes immediately without waiting, which is a significant deviation from its regular operation. 5. Conclude that max_standby_streaming_delay is a special knob due to the presence of a special value (-1) that changes its behavior fundamentally.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
