{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'max_prepared_transactions' sets the maximum number of transactions that can be in the prepared state simultaneously. The description mentions that setting this parameter to zero disables the prepared-transaction feature. This indicates that the knob has a special value (0) that changes its function, which is a characteristic of a 'special' knob. Therefore, I classify this knob as a 'special' knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
