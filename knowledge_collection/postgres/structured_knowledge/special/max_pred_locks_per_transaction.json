Determine if it has any special values that deviate from its natural numerical order, such as -1 or 0, which might indicate a special function like disabling a feature. 4. If such a special value exists and changes the knob's behavior significantly, classify it as a 'special knob'. 5. If no such special value is found, classify it as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": "null"}
