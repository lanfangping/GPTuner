It controls the maximum number of join paths that the planner will consider for a query. A higher value allows the planner to consider more join paths, potentially leading to better query plans but at the cost of increased planning time.", "step3": "Determine if 'join_collapse_limit' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly from its regular numerical operation. In PostgreSQL, setting 'join_collapse_limit' to 1 disables the planner's ability to rearrange join order, effectively making it a special value.", "step4": "Conclude that 'join_collapse_limit' is a special knob because setting it to 1 changes its behavior fundamentally, unlike other numerical values which simply adjust the limit within the same functional context."}, "special_knob": true, "special_value": 1}
