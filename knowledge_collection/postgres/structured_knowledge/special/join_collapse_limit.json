{"think_procedure": "First, we read the description of the knob. We see that the knob 'join_collapse_limit' has a default value and can be set to different values to change its behavior. However, there is a specific value, 1, that changes the behavior of the knob significantly. When set to 1, it prevents any reordering of explicit JOINs, which is a different function compared to its regular operation. Therefore, we can classify this knob as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 1}
