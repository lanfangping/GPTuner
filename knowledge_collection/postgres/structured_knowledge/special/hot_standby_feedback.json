{"think_procedure": "First, we read the description of the knob. The knob 'hot_standby_feedback' is a setting that specifies whether a hot standby will send feedback to the primary or upstream standby about queries currently executing on the standby. It does not mention any special numerical values that would change the function of the knob, such as -1 or 0. It only mentions that the default value is 'off' and it can be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. Therefore, it does not seem to be a 'special' numerical knob that has special values breaking the natural order.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
