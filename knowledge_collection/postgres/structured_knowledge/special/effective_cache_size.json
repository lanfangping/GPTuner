{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'effective_cache_size' is a special knob, first, review the PostgreSQL documentation to understand the function and configuration range of the knob. The 'effective_cache_size' knob in PostgreSQL is used to set an estimate of the memory available for disk caching by the operating system and within the database itself, not counting the memory directly used by the database (e.g., for buffers). This knob does not have any documented special values such as -1 or 0 that change its behavior radically (e.g., disabling a feature). It is measured in blocks and typically set to a value that reflects the system's memory resources. Therefore, it behaves as a regular numerical setting without special values that alter its fundamental behavior.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
