{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'autovacuum_max_workers' knob in PostgreSQL is a 'special knob', we need to understand its function and the impact of its values. First, we look up the official documentation or credible sources to find out what this knob does. According to PostgreSQL documentation, 'autovacuum_max_workers' sets the maximum number of autovacuum processes that can be running at one time. The next step is to check if there are any special values for this setting which change its behavior drastically, such as disabling autovacuum or any other non-linear behavior. After reviewing the PostgreSQL documentation, it is observed that setting 'autovacuum_max_workers' to 0 would not start any autovacuum processes, effectively disabling the autovacuum feature. This is a special behavior as it deviates from the knob's regular incremental numeric behavior where increasing the value increases the number of workers. Hence, 0 can be considered a special value.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
