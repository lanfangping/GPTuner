{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'autovacuum_max_workers' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its function: it controls the maximum number of autovacuum worker processes that can run simultaneously. 3. Determine if it has a special value that changes its behavior significantly. 4. Research or recall that setting 'autovacuum_max_workers' to 0 disables the autovacuum feature entirely, which is a significant deviation from its normal operation. 5. Conclude that 'autovacuum_max_workers' is a special knob due to this behavior.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
