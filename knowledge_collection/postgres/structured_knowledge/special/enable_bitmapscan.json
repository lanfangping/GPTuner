{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'enable_bitmapscan' from PostgreSQL. 2. Research the behavior of this knob: Understand what values it can take and what each value represents. 3. Determine if it has any special values that alter its behavior in a non-linear or non-sequential way compared to other values. 4. Check if setting this knob to any particular value, such as -1 or 0, significantly changes the behavior or disables a feature, which is different from simply tuning performance or capability. 5. Conclude whether it is a 'special knob' based on whether it has such a special value.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
