{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'autovacuum_work_mem' specifies the maximum amount of memory to be used by each autovacuum worker process. It is mentioned that it defaults to -1, which indicates that the value of maintenance_work_mem should be used instead. This suggests that the knob has a special value (-1) that changes its regular operation, thus it can be classified as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
