{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'autovacuum_work_mem' is a special knob in PostgreSQL, we need to understand what the knob does and if it has any special values that alter its regular behavior. First, we look up the documentation or source code to find the description and usage of 'autovacuum_work_mem'. According to PostgreSQL documentation, 'autovacuum_work_mem' specifies the maximum amount of memory to be used by each autovacuum worker process. If set to -1 (the default), the maintenance_work_mem is used instead. This indicates that setting 'autovacuum_work_mem' to -1 changes its behavior significantly, switching the memory amount from a specified value to whatever is set for 'maintenance_work_mem'. Thus, -1 is a special value that alters the regular operation of this knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
