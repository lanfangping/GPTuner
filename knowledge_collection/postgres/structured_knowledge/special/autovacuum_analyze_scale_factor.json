{"think_procedure": "First, we look at the description of the knob. The knob 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' specifies a fraction of the table size to add to autovacuum_analyze_threshold when deciding whether to trigger an ANALYZE. The default is 0.1 (10% of table size). This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters. There is no mention of any special values such as -1 or 0 that would change the function of the knob or disable a feature. Therefore, it is not a 'special' knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
