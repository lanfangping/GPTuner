{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: log_rotation_age. 2. Understand the function of log_rotation_age in PostgreSQL: it specifies the maximum age of a log file before it is rotated. 3. Determine if log_rotation_age has a special value that alters its behavior significantly from its regular numerical operation. 4. Research or recall that log_rotation_age can be set to 0, which disables time-based log file rotation, making it behave differently than when set to a positive number. 5. Conclude that log_rotation_age is a special knob due to the presence of a special value (0) that changes its functionality.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
