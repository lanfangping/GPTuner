{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'bgwriter_lru_maxpages' controls how many buffers will be written by the background writer in each round. It is mentioned that setting this knob to zero disables background writing. This indicates that the knob has a special value that changes its function, which is a characteristic of a 'special' knob. Therefore, I classify this knob as a 'special' knob. The special value for this knob is 0, which disables background writing.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
