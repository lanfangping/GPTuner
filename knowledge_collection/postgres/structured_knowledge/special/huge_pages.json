{"think_procedure": "The first step is to understand the description of the knob. The 'huge_pages' knob controls whether huge pages are requested for the main shared memory area. The valid values are 'try', 'on', and 'off'. These are not numerical values, but rather categorical. Therefore, this knob does not have a natural order.

Therefore, this knob is not a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
