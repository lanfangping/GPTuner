{"think_procedure": "1. Understand the function of the 'default_statistics_target' knob in PostgreSQL. This knob sets the default statistics target for table columns without a column-specific target set, which influences the level of detail of statistics collected for query planning optimizations. 2. Research whether 'default_statistics_target' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly, such as disabling statistics collection or changing the method of statistics collection. 3. Review PostgreSQL documentation and community resources to verify if there are any non-sequential or non-intuitive values for 'default_statistics_target' that would classify it as a 'special knob'. 4. Confirm if typical settings (e.g., a range of integers) for 'default_statistics_target' include any outliers with special functions.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
