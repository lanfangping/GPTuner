{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'default_statistics_target' sets the default statistics target for table columns without a column-specific target set via ALTER TABLE SET STATISTICS. It mentions that larger values increase the time needed to do ANALYZE, but might improve the quality of the planner's estimates. The default is 100. There is no mention of any special values such as -1 or 0 that would change the function of the knob or disable a feature. Therefore, this knob does not seem to be a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
