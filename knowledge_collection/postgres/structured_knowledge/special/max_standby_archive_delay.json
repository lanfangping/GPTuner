I noticed that the knob has a special value of -1, which changes the behavior of the knob to allow the standby to wait indefinitely for conflicting queries to complete. This is a different function compared to its regular operation, which is to determine how long the standby server should wait before canceling standby queries. Therefore, this knob can be classified as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
