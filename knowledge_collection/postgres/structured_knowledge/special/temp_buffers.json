{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'temp_buffers' sets the maximum amount of memory used for temporary buffers within each database session. It is specified in blocks or bytes, and the default is eight megabytes (8MB). The setting can be changed within individual sessions, but only before the first use of temporary tables within the session. The description does not mention any special values that would change the function of the knob or disable a feature. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
