{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: temp_buffers. 2. Determine if temp_buffers has a natural order for its numerical values. 3. Check if temp_buffers has any special values that deviate from its natural order, such as -1 or 0, which might indicate a special function like disabling a feature. 4. Research or recall if setting temp_buffers to a specific value (e.g., -1 or 0) changes its behavior significantly compared to its regular operation. 5. Conclude whether temp_buffers is a 'special knob' based on the presence of such special values and their impact on its functionality.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
