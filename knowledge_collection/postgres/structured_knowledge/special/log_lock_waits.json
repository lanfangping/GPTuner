{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'log_lock_waits' knob in PostgreSQL is a 'special knob', first, understand what the knob does. This configuration parameter is a boolean type, meaning it accepts values true or false. It controls whether a session's wait for a lock that lasts longer than deadlock_timeout is logged. If set to true, these waits are logged, which helps in identifying locking issues. Since this knob does not accept numerical values and is strictly boolean, it does not have numerical 'special values' like -1 or 0 that alter its behavior in a non-standard way for numerical knobs. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria of a 'special numerical knob' as it is not even numerical.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
