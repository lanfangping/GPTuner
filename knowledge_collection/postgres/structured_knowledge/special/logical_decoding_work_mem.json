{"think_procedure": "The description of the knob 'logical_decoding_work_mem' does not mention any special values that would change the function of the knob. It only specifies the maximum amount of memory to be used by logical decoding. It defaults to 64 megabytes (64MB) and can be set higher than work_mem. There is no mention of a value such as -1 or 0 that would disable a feature or change the function of the knob. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
