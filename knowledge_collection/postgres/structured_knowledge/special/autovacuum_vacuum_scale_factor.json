{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' specifies a fraction of the table size to add to autovacuum_vacuum_threshold when deciding whether to trigger a VACUUM. The default is 0.2 (20% of table size). This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters. There is no mention of any special values that would change the function of this knob, such as disabling a feature. Therefore, this knob does not have any special values that break the natural order.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
