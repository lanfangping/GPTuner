{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'checkpoint_completion_target' specifies the target of checkpoint completion as a fraction of total time between checkpoints. The default value is 0.5. It can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. There is no mention of any special values that would change the function of this knob, such as disabling a feature. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
