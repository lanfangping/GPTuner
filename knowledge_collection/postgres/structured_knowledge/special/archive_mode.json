{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'archive_mode'. 2. Determine if 'archive_mode' has a natural numerical order. 3. Check if 'archive_mode' has any special values that deviate from its natural order, such as -1 or 0, which might indicate a different functionality. 4. Research or recall that 'archive_mode' in PostgreSQL can be set to 'on', 'off', or 'always', where 'off' effectively disables the feature, acting as a special value. 5. Conclude that 'archive_mode' is a special knob because setting it to 'off' changes its functionality significantly compared to its regular operation.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
