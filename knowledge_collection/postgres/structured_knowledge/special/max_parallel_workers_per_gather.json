{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' knob in PostgreSQL is a special knob, I first need to understand what this knob does and how its values affect PostgreSQL's behavior. This knob sets the maximum number of workers that can be launched to parallelize a single gather node in a query plan. The default value and the range it can take are crucial to understand. According to the PostgreSQL documentation, setting this value to 0 disables the use of parallel workers for the gather node, which significantly alters its behavior from parallel processing to no parallel processing at all. This special value (0) changes the operational behavior of the database system, thus breaking the natural order of the numeric values where higher values mean more parallel workers. Hence, the knob has a special value.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
