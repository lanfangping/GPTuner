{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: max_parallel_workers_per_gather. 2. Understand its regular function: it controls the maximum number of parallel workers that can be started by a single Gather or Gather Merge node. 3. Determine if it has any special values: setting it to 0 disables parallel query execution for the session. 4. Conclude that it is a special knob because setting it to 0 changes its behavior significantly, disabling a feature rather than limiting the number of workers.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
