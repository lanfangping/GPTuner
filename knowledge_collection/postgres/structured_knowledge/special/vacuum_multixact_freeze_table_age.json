{"think_procedure": "First, we look at the description of the knob. The knob 'vacuum_multixact_freeze_table_age' is a setting that determines the age at which VACUUM performs an aggressive scan.

Therefore, this knob does not have a special value that breaks the natural order and performs a different function.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
