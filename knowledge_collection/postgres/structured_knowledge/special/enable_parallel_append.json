{"think_procedure": "To classify the 'enable_parallel_append' knob of PostgreSQL, I first consult the official PostgreSQL documentation to understand its function and possible values. According to the PostgreSQL documentation, 'enable_parallel_append' is a boolean knob used to enable or disable the parallel append operation during query execution. The possible values for this knob are either 'on' or 'off'. A value of 'on' enables the feature, allowing the planner to consider using a parallel append plan, while a value of 'off' disables this feature, preventing the planner from considering it. Given that this knob does not have numerical values or any special numerical values that alter its behavior beyond the typical on/off functionality, it is not classified as a 'special numerical knob'.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
