{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'shared_buffers' in PostgreSQL is a 'special knob', we first need to understand what the knob does and if it has any special values that alter its behavior significantly. The 'shared_buffers' parameter in PostgreSQL configures the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers. A typical setting for 'shared_buffers' is a number representing the amount of memory in megabytes. We need to check if there are any documented special values like -1 or 0 which might disable or change the behavior of the buffer management drastically, different from just adjusting the amount of memory used.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
