{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'vacuum_cost_page_hit' is about the estimated cost for vacuuming a buffer found in the shared buffer cache. It does not mention any special values that would change the function of the knob, such as disabling a feature. Therefore, it seems to behave like a regular numerical knob. The default value is one, but this does not seem to be a special value that changes the function of the knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
