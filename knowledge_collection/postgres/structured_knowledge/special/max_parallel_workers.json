{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'max_parallel_workers' is a 'special knob', I first need to understand its role and behavior in PostgreSQL. This knob configures the maximum number of parallel workers that can be used by the system. I checked the PostgreSQL documentation to see if there are any special values that change the behavior of this setting drastically, such as disabling a feature or altering its operation significantly. According to the documentation, setting 'max_parallel_workers' to 0 effectively disables the use of parallel workers for executing queries. This is a significant deviation from its regular behavior, where a higher value allows more workers to be used for parallel query execution.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
