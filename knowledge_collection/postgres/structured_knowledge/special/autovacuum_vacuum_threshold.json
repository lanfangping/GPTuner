{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' specifies the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples needed to trigger a VACUUM in any one table. The default is 50 tuples. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line; but the setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing table storage parameters. There is no mention of any special values such as -1 or 0 that would change the function of the knob or disable a feature. Therefore, this knob does not have any special values that break the natural order.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
