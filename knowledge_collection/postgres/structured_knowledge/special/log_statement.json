{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'log_statement'. 2. Determine if 'log_statement' has a natural order in its settings. 3. Check if 'log_statement' has any special values that deviate from its natural order, such as -1 or 0, which might indicate a different functionality. 4. Research or recall that 'log_statement' in PostgreSQL can be set to 'none', 'ddl', 'mod', or 'all', where 'none' effectively disables the logging feature, acting as a special value. 5. Conclude that 'log_statement' is a special knob because it has a special value ('none') that disables its regular functionality.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "none"}
