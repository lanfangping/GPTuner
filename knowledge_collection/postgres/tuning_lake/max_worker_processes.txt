To optimize the performance and stability of your server system, set the 'max_worker_processes' knob, during server start, to a value that reflects the maximum number of background processes your system can support. Both the master server and any standby servers should have the 'max_worker_processes' set to the same value — or the standby should have a higher value — to allow queries to run efficiently. The default value if unspecified is 8. The overall configuration should consider a detailed approach that sums up all relevant worker parameters to fine-tune your system's capabilities.
