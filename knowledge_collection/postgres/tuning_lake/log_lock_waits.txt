Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Priority Analysis**:
   - The highest-priority suggestion is `manual_suggestion`, followed by `web_suggestion`, and then `gpt_suggestion`.
   - `web_suggestion` is `None`, so it provides no additional information.
   - `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion` both recommend enabling `log_lock_waits`, but they differ on the `deadlock_timeout` value (`1 second` vs. `2 seconds`).

2. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Since `manual_suggestion` has higher priority, its value for `deadlock_timeout` (`1 second`) should be retained, and the conflicting value from `gpt_suggestion` (`2 seconds`) should be discarded.

3. **Comprehensive Suggestion**:
   - Combine the information from `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`, prioritizing `manual_suggestion` where there is overlap or conflict.

**Final Comprehensive Suggestion**:
```json
{
  "log_lock_waits": "on",
  "deadlock_timeout": "1 second",
  "note": "it is off by default and can only be modified by superusers."
}
``` 

This suggestion encapsulates the key points from all three suggestions while resolving conflicts in favor of the higher-priority `manual_suggestion`.
