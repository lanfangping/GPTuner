Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to set the 'effective_cache_size' in Postgres as an estimate of the available memory for disk caching by the operating system and within the database itself. This setting influences the use of index or sequential scans, considering both PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel's disk cache for PostgreSQL data files. It does not affect the size of shared memory allocated by PostgreSQL or reserve kernel disk cache. The default value is 4 gigabytes (4GB), and if specified without units, it is taken as blocks, typically 8kB. However, if Postgres is the only major service on the machine, you might consider setting it to about 50%-70% of the total RAM. If the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL, set 'effective_cache_size' to a lower value, approximately calculated as: system RAM - (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) * 1.1.
