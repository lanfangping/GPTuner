To create a comprehensive suggestion based on the three provided inputs, we will prioritize the information as follows: **manual_suggestion** (highest priority), **web_suggestion** (middle priority), and **gpt_suggestion** (lowest priority). We will integrate the details from all three suggestions, resolving any contradictions by deferring to the higher-priority source.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `effective_cache_size` knob in PostgreSQL is used to inform the query planner about the size of the disk cache available for a single query. This setting influences the planner's decision to use index scans or sequential scans, taking into account both PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel's disk cache for PostgreSQL data files. Importantly, this knob does not affect the amount of physical RAM used by queries or the size of shared memory allocated by PostgreSQL. 

The default value for `effective_cache_size` is 4 gigabytes (4GB). If specified without units, it is interpreted as blocks, typically 8kB each. To optimize performance, you can calculate the value using the formula:  
`system RAM - (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) * 1.1`.  
This formula ensures that the setting accounts for other memory usage on the system. If the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL, you may need to set a lower value. Alternatively, as a simpler guideline, you can set `effective_cache_size` to approximately 75-80% of your system's total available RAM (e.g., 12GB for a system with 16GB of RAM). However, the formula-based approach is recommended for more precise tuning. 

By combining these insights, the `effective_cache_size` should be configured to balance the query planner's assumptions with the system's overall memory usage, ensuring optimal query performance without overcommitting resources.
