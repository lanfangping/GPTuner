As a suggestion, the 'shared_preload_libraries' knob in postgres should be set to the list of shared libraries that need to be preloaded at server start. This is a server parameter that can help avoid library startup time, although it may slightly increase the time to start each new server process. The libraries should be separated by commas, for example, 'shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements,auto_explain''. It should be set according to the requirements of the extensions you are planning to use, with 'pg_stat_statements' or 'pg_stat_monitor' being commonly used. Please note that any changes to this parameter require a server restart.
