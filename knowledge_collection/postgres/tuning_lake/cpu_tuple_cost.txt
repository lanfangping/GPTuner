To create a comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information from the `manual_suggestion` first, followed by the `gpt_suggestion`, and ignore the `web_suggestion` since it is `None`. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Manual Suggestion**: The `cpu_tuple_cost` parameter in PostgreSQL is used to adjust the planner's estimated cost of processing each row in a query, with the default value set to **0.01**. This is the highest-priority information and forms the foundation of the summary.

2. **GPT Suggestion**: This provides additional context on how to adjust `cpu_tuple_cost` based on workload types:
   - For OLTP systems, the default value of **0.01** is typically suitable.
   - For OLAP or read-heavy workloads, consider lowering it to **0.005** to prioritize sequential scans.
   - For write-heavy workloads, increase it to **0.02** to discourage large sequential scans.
   - Always test and adjust based on query performance.

3. **Web Suggestion**: This is `None`, so it is ignored.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `cpu_tuple_cost` parameter in PostgreSQL is used to adjust the planner's estimated cost of processing each row in a query, with the default value set to **0.01**. Depending on your workload type, you may need to adjust this value:
- For OLTP systems, the default value of **0.01** is typically appropriate.
- For OLAP or read-heavy workloads, consider lowering it to **0.005** to prioritize sequential scans.
- For write-heavy workloads, increase it to **0.02** to discourage large sequential scans.
Always test and fine-tune the value based on your specific query performance and workload characteristics.
