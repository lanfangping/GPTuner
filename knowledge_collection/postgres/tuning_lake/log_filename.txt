To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), `web_suggestion` (middle priority), and `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). Since the `web_suggestion` is `None`, we will focus on the `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`. Both suggestions emphasize the importance of using a unique naming convention for the `log_filename` parameter in PostgreSQL, but the `manual_suggestion` provides more detailed and higher-priority information.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
When the `logging_collector` is enabled in PostgreSQL, the `log_filename` parameter should be configured to use `strftime` patterns (e.g., `postgresql-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S.log`) to generate time-varying log file names. This ensures that log files are uniquely named and prevents overwrites. Additionally, if CSV-format output is enabled, the log file names will automatically append `.csv`. To avoid disk space issues, implement log rotation for static log file names. This approach aids in effective log management and ensures that logs are organized and accessible over time. 

This summary combines the key points from both suggestions, prioritizing the `manual_suggestion` for accuracy and detail.
