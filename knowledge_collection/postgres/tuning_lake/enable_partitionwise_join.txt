**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

The `enable_partitionwise_join` knob should be toggled to allow the query planner to perform partitionwise joins between partitioned tables with matching partition keys of the same data type. This feature is beneficial for optimizing query performance, but it defaults to off due to the potential increase in CPU and memory usage during the planning phase.
