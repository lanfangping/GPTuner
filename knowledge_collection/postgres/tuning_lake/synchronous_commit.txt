The 'synchronous_commit' knob allows you to control the behavior of transaction commits with regard to writing WAL records to disk before signaling success. You can configure it to various settings including: 'on' which is the default and waits for the WAL records to be written to both local disk and confirmed at standbys; 'remote_apply' where the commit waits until the standby has applied the changes; 'remote_write' that waits for the standby to write the changes; 'local' which only waits for the local disk write; and 'off', where there is no wait, potentially risking up to three times the wal_writer_delay of data loss in the event of a crash. This setting provides a balance between performance and durability.
