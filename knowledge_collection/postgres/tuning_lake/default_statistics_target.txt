To optimally configure the 'default_statistics_target' knob in PostgreSQL, set it at a starting value of 100, as this is the default setting and aids in improving the planner's estimate quality. Gradually increase the value, potentially up to 1000, and monitor the query performance closely. Be aware that higher values provide more detailed statistics, enhancing planning accuracy, but this could also result in longer analysis time. Adjust the setting to find a balance that promotes both effective execution efficiency and acceptable planning time.
