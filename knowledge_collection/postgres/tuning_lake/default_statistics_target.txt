### Comprehensive Suggestion:

Adjust the `default_statistics_target` knob to improve the quality of the planner's estimates, which can be particularly beneficial for large tables. Medium-sized systems typically perform well with values around 200, while larger systems may need to increase this value to 500 or 1000. Be mindful of the trade-off between improved estimation quality and the increased time required for analysis.
