Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'checkpoint_warning' setting in your PostgreSQL configuration. This setting logs a warning message if checkpoints, which are triggered by the filling of WAL segment files, occur within a specified time frame. This could indicate that 'max_wal_size' should be increased. However, no warnings will be issued if 'checkpoint_timeout' is less than 'checkpoint_warning'. It's also worth noting that this setting could alert you if checkpoints are happening too frequently. Any changes to these settings should be made either via the postgresql.conf file or the server command line.
