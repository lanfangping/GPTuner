**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

Set the `vacuum_cost_delay` value to a small number, typically less than 1 millisecond, to activate cost-based vacuuming. This approach balances the trade-off between I/O performance and CPU usage during vacuum operations, ensuring that vacuum processes are paused briefly when the cost limit is exceeded. While higher values can reduce I/O impact, they are not recommended due to potential increases in vacuum duration. On busy systems, consider slightly increasing this value to enhance background writer activity, but maintain it in the range of less than 1 millisecond to avoid significant delays.
