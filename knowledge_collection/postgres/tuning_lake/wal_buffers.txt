Suggestion: The 'wal_buffers' knob is designated for shared memory allocated to Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data that has not been written to disk yet. By default, it is set to -1, which corresponds to approximately 3% of shared_buffers. You can manually configure this setting. Any value set below 32kB will be considered as 32kB. This configuration is utilized at every transaction commit and can enhance write performance on servers experiencing heavy loads.
