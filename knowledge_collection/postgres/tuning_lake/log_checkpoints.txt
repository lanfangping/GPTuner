I suggest activating the 'log_checkpoints' knob. This feature, when turned on, logs checkpoints and restartpoints in the server log, providing valuable statistics such as the number of buffers written and the time taken to write them. This setting can only be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. By default, it is turned off, but turning it on will allow you to monitor when checkpoints occur.
