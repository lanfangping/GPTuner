### Comprehensive Suggestion:

The `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` parameter, which defaults to 0.1, determines whether an ANALYZE operation should be triggered by adding a fraction of the table size to the `autovacuum_analyze_threshold`. This setting can be adjusted in the `postgresql.conf` file or via the server command line to optimize database performance.
