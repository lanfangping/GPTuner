For configuring the 'max_connections' knob in PostgreSQL, it's essential to consider a few critical recommendations. Firstly, set this parameter in accordance to the master server's value on a standby server, ensuring that it meets or exceeds the master's settings, typically defaulted at 100, and remember that adjustments must only be made at server start. If employing connection pooling, particularly in transaction mode, set 'max_connections' as a low multiple (2-5x) of the number of server cores; adjust according to the minimal number of concurrent users that cannot be queued for session mode. If connection pooling is not in use, the parameter should directly reflect the required number of concurrent users, keeping in mind to ensure optimal server memory utilization, where each connection should ideally reserve around 10 MB.
