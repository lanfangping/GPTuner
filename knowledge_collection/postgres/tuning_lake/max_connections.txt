**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

The 'max_connections' parameter in PostgreSQL should be set to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization. It should be configured to accommodate the number of concurrent connections required by the application, considering the available RAM and the memory consumption per connection (around 5 MB with a 25% overhead for system processes). For most use cases, connection pooling is recommended, and the 'max_connections' value should be set as a low multiple (2-5x) of the number of cores on the server when using transaction mode, or to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued in session mode. If not using connection pooling, the value should be set to the required number of concurrent users. Additionally, on standby servers, the 'max_connections' value must be equal to or higher than the master server's value, with adjustments only possible at server start.
