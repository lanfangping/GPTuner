I suggest setting the 'autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age' knob in Postgres to a value that is suitable for your database's workload. This knob specifies the age, in multixacts, that a table's pg_class.relminmxid field can reach before a VACUUM operation is automatically initiated to prevent multixact ID wraparound within the table. The default is set at 400 million multixacts. This parameter should be more than 'multixact_freeze_min_age' to ensure the autovacuum process is triggered to prevent XID wraparound issues. Please note that this parameter can only be set at server start.
