### Comprehensive Suggestion:

The `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age` parameter defines the maximum age, in multixacts, that a table's `pg_class.relminmxid` field can reach before an automatic VACUUM operation is triggered to prevent multixact ID wraparound within the table. The default value is set at 400 million multixacts, and this parameter can only be configured during server startup.
