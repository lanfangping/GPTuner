As a suggestion, consider adjusting the 'max_pred_locks_per_page' parameter in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. This knob controls the maximum number of rows, default being 2, that can be predicate-locked on a single page before the lock is upgraded to cover the entire page. If you have a high contention workload, you might want to increase this value, but be aware that it will consume more shared memory.
