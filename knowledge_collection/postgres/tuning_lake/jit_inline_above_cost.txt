I suggest adjusting the 'jit_inline_above_cost' knob, which sets the query cost threshold. By default, it is set at 500000, and it determines the point at which JIT compilation attempts to inline functions and operators to potentially improve execution speed. However, this may increase planning time. Please note that this value cannot be set lower than 'jit_above_cost'. If you wish to disable inlining, you can set it to -1.
