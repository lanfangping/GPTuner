I suggest setting the 'wal_keep_size' parameter to define the minimum size of past log file segments, in megabytes, that should be retained in the pg_wal directory. This setting is essential for streaming replication, as it ensures that log files are available in case a standby server requires them. The default value of this parameter is zero, which means that no extra segments will be kept for standby purposes unless explicitly specified.
