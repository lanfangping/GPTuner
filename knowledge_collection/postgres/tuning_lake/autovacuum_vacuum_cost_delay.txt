To optimize your Postgres system, adjust the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' value. This parameter controls the delay for automatic VACUUM operations, which by default is set to 2 milliseconds. You can modify this value in the postgresql.conf file or directly on the server command line. Additionally, it's possible to override this setting for individual tables. If your system is faster, consider reducing this value; if the autovacuum process is causing performance issues, consider increasing it.
