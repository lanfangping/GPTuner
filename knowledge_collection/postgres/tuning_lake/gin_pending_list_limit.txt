Suggestion: The 'gin_pending_list_limit' knob in Postgres is responsible for setting the size of a GIN index's pending list, which by default is four megabytes (4MB). If the list exceeds this size, the entries are moved to the main GIN data structure. This setting can be customized for individual GIN indexes. Increasing this value may speed up GIN index creation, but be aware that it could also lead to increased memory usage.
