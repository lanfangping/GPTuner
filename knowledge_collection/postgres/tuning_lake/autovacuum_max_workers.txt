To effectively manage the number of autovacuum processes that can run simultaneously in your database system, set the 'autovacuum_max_workers' parameter. This parameter, which defaults to three, dictates the limit and can only be adjusted at server startup. Be sure to configure this setting according to your system's needs before initiating the server to optimize performance and maintenance workflows.
