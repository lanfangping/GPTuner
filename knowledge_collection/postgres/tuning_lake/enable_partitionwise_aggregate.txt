Suggestion: Enable the 'enable_partitionwise_aggregate' knob to allow the query planner to use partitionwise grouping or aggregation, which processes grouping or aggregation on partitioned tables separately per partition. This setting can increase CPU time and memory usage during the planning phase and is disabled by default.
