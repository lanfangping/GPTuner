To optimize your system's performance, adjust the 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' setting carefully, considering its impact on different types of workloads. For high throughput OLTP systems, it's typically best to keep this setting at its default value of 2 to avoid excessive resource utilization, as the system's efficiency could be compromised if the requested workers aren't available. For analytical or data warehouse systems, consider increasing the value, but ensure it remains only a fraction of the total core count. Always review the associated 'work_mem' setting when making adjustments, as it directly influences the effectiveness of this parameter. This configuration is determined by the overall limits set by 'max_worker_processes' and 'max_parallel_workers'.
