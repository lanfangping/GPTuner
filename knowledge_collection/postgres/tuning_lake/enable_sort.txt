To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), `web_suggestion` (middle priority), and `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). Since the `web_suggestion` is `None`, we will focus on the `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Manual Suggestion**: This provides the foundational information about the `enable_sort` knob, stating that it controls the query planner's use of explicit sort steps, with the default setting being `on`. It also clarifies that explicit sorts cannot be completely eliminated.
2. **GPT Suggestion**: This adds context on when to enable or disable the `enable_sort` knob based on dataset size and query performance considerations. It suggests enabling it for small to medium datasets (e.g., less than 10,000 rows) and disabling it for large datasets or when sorting is unnecessary to reduce query overhead.

Since there is no contradiction between the two suggestions, we can combine them into a single comprehensive suggestion.

### Final Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `enable_sort` knob in PostgreSQL controls the query planner's use of explicit sort steps, with the default setting being `on`. While it is not possible to completely eliminate explicit sorts, you can optimize query performance by enabling it (`on`) for queries involving small to medium datasets (e.g., less than 10,000 rows) where sorting operations are beneficial. For large datasets or when sorting is unnecessary, disabling it (`off`) can reduce query overhead and improve performance. Always consider the dataset size and query requirements when configuring this setting.
