To create a comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information from the `manual_suggestion` first, followed by the `gpt_suggestion`, and ignore the `web_suggestion` as it is `None`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Manual Suggestion**: This provides the foundational understanding of the `log_rotation_age` parameter. It explains that the parameter sets the maximum time an individual log file is used before a new one is created, with values interpreted as minutes if no units are specified. It also mentions that setting it to zero disables time-based log rotation.

2. **GPT Suggestion**: This provides specific values for the `log_rotation_age` parameter, suggesting values like `1440` (24 hours) for daily rotation or `60` (1 hour) for more frequent rotations. It also emphasizes balancing log file size and retention needs.

3. **Web Suggestion**: Since this is `None`, it does not contribute any additional information.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
When the `logging_collector` is enabled in PostgreSQL, the `log_rotation_age` parameter determines the maximum time an individual log file is used before a new one is created. By default, this is set to 24 hours (1440 minutes), but you can adjust it to smaller intervals, such as 60 minutes (1 hour), for more frequent rotations. If no units are specified, the value is interpreted in minutes. Setting `log_rotation_age` to zero disables time-based log rotation. Adjust this parameter based on your log file size and retention needs to ensure efficient log management.
