Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'shared_buffers' value in Postgres, which sets the memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers. Typically, this defaults to 128MB. For servers with 1GB or more RAM, it's reasonable to set 'shared_buffers' to 25% of system memory, but not more than 40%. However, systems with less than 1GB RAM should use a smaller percentage. It's also important to note that each Postgres instance will reserve its own memory allocations. This variable is in direct relation with OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`. Conduct your own benchmarks varying this parameter to find the optimal setting for your system. If your system has hundreds of GBs, consider setting up huge pages. Adjust accordingly for non-dedicated servers.
