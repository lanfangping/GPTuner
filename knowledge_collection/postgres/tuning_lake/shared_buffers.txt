Suggestion: For optimal performance, configure the 'shared_buffers' setting in your PostgreSQL database based on the server's total RAM. For systems with 1GB or more RAM, allocate 25% to 40% of the system memory to 'shared_buffers'. For systems with less than 1GB RAM, use a smaller percentage. In addition, it is advisable to perform your own benchmarks to observe the impacts of varying this setting. Take into account that 'shared_buffers' interacts with OS kernel parameters such as `shmmax` and `shmall`. If managing very large datasets, especially in the hundreds of GBs range, consider implementing huge pages to enhance memory management efficiency. Adjust these settings while also considering the unique memory requirements and allocations if your server is not dedicated solely to the PostgreSQL instance.
