To summarize the provided suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the highest-priority suggestion**: The `manual_suggestion` and `web_suggestion` are both `None`, so the highest-priority suggestion is the `gpt_suggestion`.  
2. **Extract the key information**: The `gpt_suggestion` recommends setting the `default_with_oids` knob in PostgreSQL to `off` (or `false`) because OIDs are deprecated and not recommended for use. It also provides two methods to achieve this: modifying the `postgresql.conf` file or using the `ALTER SYSTEM SET default_with_oids = off;` command, followed by a restart or reload of the PostgreSQL service.  
3. **Structure the summary as a suggestion**: Since there are no contradictory suggestions, the summary will directly reflect the `gpt_suggestion`.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
To ensure optimal PostgreSQL configuration and avoid deprecated features, it is recommended to set the `default_with_oids` knob to `off` (or `false`). This can be achieved by either modifying the `postgresql.conf` file or executing the `ALTER SYSTEM SET default_with_oids = off;` command. After making this change, restart or reload the PostgreSQL service to apply the new configuration. This practice aligns with the deprecation of OIDs and promotes the use of modern, supported features in PostgreSQL.
