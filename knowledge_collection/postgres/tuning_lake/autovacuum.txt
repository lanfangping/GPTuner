Enable the 'autovacuum' feature in PostgreSQL by setting 'autovacuum = on' in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line, as it controls the activation of the autovacuum launcher daemon, which is crucial for optimal database performance. Ensure that 'track_counts' is also enabled, as it is required for the autovacuum function to operate effectively. Customize the autovacuum performance by adjusting parameters such as 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' around 0.2, 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' at 0.1, and 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' typically within the range of 20ms to 50ms to suit your system's workload. Additionally, you can disable autovacuum for individual tables if necessary.
