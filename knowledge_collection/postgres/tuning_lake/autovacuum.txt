The 'autovacuum' knob in Postgres, which controls the activation of the autovacuum launcher daemon in the server, is typically set to 'on' to enable automatic vacuuming. This is enabled by default but also requires 'track_counts' to be enabled for it to function. The frequency and specifics of the vacuuming process can be adjusted with parameters like 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' and 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor', which are usually set as a fraction of the total number of tuples in a table, often 0.2 and 0.1 respectively. These settings can be adjusted only in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line, with the option to disable it for individual tables.
