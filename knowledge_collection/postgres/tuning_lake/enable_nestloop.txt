Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to utilize the 'enable_nestloop' knob in the query planner of Postgres. This feature, which is enabled by default, allows the use of nested-loop join plans. While it cannot be completely suppressed, it can be discouraged if other methods are available. The 'enable_nestloop' knob can be set to either 'on' or 'off', with 'on' enabling the nested-loop join method and 'off' disabling it.
