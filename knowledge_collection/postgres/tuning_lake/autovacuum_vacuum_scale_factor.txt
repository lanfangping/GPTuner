**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

The `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` parameter in PostgreSQL determines when a VACUUM operation should be triggered by adding a fraction of the table size to the `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`. This parameter can be configured in the `postgresql.conf` file or via the server command line, and it can also be overridden for individual tables. The default value is set at a fraction of the table size, but it should be adjusted based on the specific characteristics of the database, such as its size and the frequency of updates. Smaller databases or those with more frequent updates may benefit from lower values, while larger databases or those with less frequent updates may use higher values.
