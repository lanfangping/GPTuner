I suggest configuring the 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' parameter, which dictates when a VACUUM is triggered by adding a fraction of the table size (defaulting to 20%) to the 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold'. This parameter can be set globally in the postgresql.conf file or directly on the server command line, and it can also be adjusted for individual tables to better manage database maintenance and performance.
