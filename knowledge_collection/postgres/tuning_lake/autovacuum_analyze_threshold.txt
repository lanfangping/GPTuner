Suggestion: Customize the 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold' setting in PostgreSQL to trigger an ANALYZE operation when at least 50 tuples are inserted, updated, or deleted in a table. This can be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file, via the server command line, or specifically for individual tables by altering table storage parameters.
