As a suggestion, you should adjust the 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold' setting in PostgreSQL. This parameter triggers an ANALYZE operation when a minimum of 50 tuples are inserted, updated, or deleted in a table. You can customize this setting in the postgresql.conf file or server command line. Additionally, it can be overridden for specific tables by altering table storage parameters.
