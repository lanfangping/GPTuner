Based on the suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'parallel_tuple_cost' knob in Postgres, which is used to set the planner's estimated cost of transferring a single tuple from one parallel worker process to another. The default value is 0.1, but it can be modified based on the cost of transferring a tuple from a worker process to a parallel leader. However, it should be adjusted carefully to encourage more parallelism without causing excessive system load.
