**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

The `bgwriter_lru_multiplier` parameter in PostgreSQL is responsible for determining the number of dirty buffers written during each round of background writing. This value is derived by multiplying the average recent need by the `bgwriter_lru_multiplier`, with the default setting being 2.0. It is important to note that this parameter can only be configured within the `postgresql.conf` file or via the server command line, and it cannot be altered dynamically during runtime.
