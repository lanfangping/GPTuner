Suggestion: To configure the volume of information recorded in the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL), adjust the 'wal_level' knob. By default, it is set to 'replica', which supports WAL archiving and replication. Setting it to 'minimal' will log only the information necessary for crash recovery, whereas the 'logical' setting includes data for logical decoding in addition to all the capabilities of the lower levels. Note that this setting can only be adjusted when the server is started.
