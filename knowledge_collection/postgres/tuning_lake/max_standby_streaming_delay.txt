To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: **manual_suggestion** (highest priority), **web_suggestion** (middle priority), and **gpt_suggestion** (lowest priority). We will integrate the key points from each suggestion while resolving any contradictions based on priority.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `max_standby_streaming_delay` parameter in Hot Standby is a critical configuration that determines the maximum duration the standby server will wait before canceling standby queries that conflict with incoming WAL entries, particularly when WAL data is received via streaming replication. The default value for this parameter is **30 seconds**, and it can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line. 

When configuring this parameter, consider the maximum lag tolerable for your system, as it acts as a ceiling for the maximum query duration before a conflicting query is canceled, especially if `hot_standby_feedback` is enabled. Avoid setting `failover_and_read_only` to `0`, as this may impact system behavior. While the `gpt_suggestion` proposes moderate and higher tolerance values (30 seconds and 5 minutes, respectively), these should be secondary to the manual and web suggestions, which emphasize the importance of aligning the parameter with system requirements and WAL streaming behavior. 

In summary, prioritize setting `max_standby_streaming_delay` based on your system's tolerance for lag and query conflicts, using the default 30 seconds as a starting point, and adjust it in the `postgresql.conf` file or server command line as needed.
