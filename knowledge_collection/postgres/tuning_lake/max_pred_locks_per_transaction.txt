Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to understand that the 'max_pred_locks_per_transaction' in Postgres controls the average number of object locks per transaction. This is calculated as max_pred_locks_per_transaction * (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions), with a default value of 64. This setting can only be adjusted at server start. If you are dealing with complex queries or a high level of concurrency, you may need to increase this value. However, be aware that each lock consumes approximately 10 bytes of shared memory.
