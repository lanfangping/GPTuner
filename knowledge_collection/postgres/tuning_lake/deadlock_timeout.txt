As a suggestion, consider adjusting the 'deadlock_timeout' setting, which determines the wait duration for a lock before a deadlock condition is checked. The default is set at one second (1s). Increasing this value can reduce unnecessary deadlock checks but may also delay the reporting of actual deadlock errors. Ideally, this setting should exceed the typical transaction time to increase the likelihood of a lock being released before a deadlock check. Additionally, this setting determines the wait time before a log message about the lock wait is issued when 'log_lock_waits' is set.
