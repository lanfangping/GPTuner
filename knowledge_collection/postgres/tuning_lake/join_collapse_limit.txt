Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'join_collapse_limit' in the planner. This knob rewrites explicit JOIN constructs into lists of FROM items when the list has no more than the set limit of items. The default value is set the same as from_collapse_limit. However, setting it to 1 prevents reordering of explicit JOINs, allowing advanced users to specify the join order. This can reduce planning time but may lead to inferior query plans. For larger joins, the planner uses the join order specified in the query.
