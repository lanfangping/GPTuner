To create a comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information from the three suggestions in the order of `manual_suggestion`, `web_suggestion`, and `gpt_suggestion`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Manual Suggestion**: This is the highest priority. It explains that the `checkpoint_completion_target` knob in PostgreSQL sets the goal for checkpoint completion as a percentage of the total time between checkpoints. The default value is 0.5, and it can only be adjusted in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.

2. **Web Suggestion**: This is the second priority. It suggests raising the value to smooth I/O activity over larger periods of time. It also mentions that for non-streaming replicas, it is recommended to keep this value within a low percentage, and on development instances, it is usual to set it to 0.9.

3. **GPT Suggestion**: This is the lowest priority. It recommends setting the `checkpoint_completion_target` to a value between 0.7 and 0.9 (e.g., 0.8) to balance checkpoint I/O load and recovery time, ensuring checkpoints complete within 80-90% of the checkpoint interval while avoiding excessive I/O spikes.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `checkpoint_completion_target` knob in PostgreSQL is used to set the goal for checkpoint completion as a percentage of the total time between checkpoints, with the default setting being 0.5. This parameter can only be adjusted in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line. To balance checkpoint I/O load and recovery time, it is recommended to set this value between **0.7 and 0.9** (e.g., 0.8), ensuring checkpoints complete within 80-90% of the checkpoint interval while avoiding excessive I/O spikes. For non-streaming replicas, it is advisable to keep this value within a low percentage, whereas on development instances, a value of 0.9 is commonly used to smooth I/O activity over larger periods of time.
