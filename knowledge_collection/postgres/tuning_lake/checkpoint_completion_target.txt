To optimize the performance of PostgreSQL, adjust the 'checkpoint_completion_target' knob, which is designed to set the completion goal for checkpoints as a percentage of the total time between checkpoints. The default setting is 0.5. This adjustment should be made either in the postgresql.conf file or directly on the server command line to effectively smooth I/O activity over larger periods of time. This setting is particularly critical if you are managing non-streaming replicas, and it is advisable to keep the value within a low percentage range to ensure reliability and performance.
