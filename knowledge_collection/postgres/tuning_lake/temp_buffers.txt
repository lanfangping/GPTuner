The 'temp_buffers' knob in Postgres sets the maximum memory used for temporary buffers in each database session, typically used for temporary tables. The default value is eight megabytes (8MB). This setting can be adjusted within sessions before the first use of temporary tables. Each increase in 'temp_buffers' costs about 64 bytes, and an additional 8192 bytes if a buffer is used. This is particularly useful if a session is executing complex queries that involve many temporary tables. However, bear in mind that this memory is not shared among sessions.
