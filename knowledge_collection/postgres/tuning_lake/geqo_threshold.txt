Suggestion: The 'geqo_threshold' knob in postgres is used for planning queries that involve at least 12 FROM items. It utilizes genetic query optimization (GEQO) for more complex queries to avoid lengthy exhaustive searches. Simpler queries typically benefit from the regular, exhaustive-search planner. This knob can be set to a specific integer value that determines the minimum number of FROM items in a query before the GEQO module is activated for query optimization.
