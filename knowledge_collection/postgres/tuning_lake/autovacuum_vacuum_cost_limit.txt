To create a comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information from the `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), followed by the `gpt_suggestion` (lower priority), and ignore the `web_suggestion` as it is `None`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **From `manual_suggestion`**:  
   - The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` parameter sets the cost limit for automatic VACUUM operations in PostgreSQL.  
   - Its default value is `-1`, which means it uses the `vacuum_cost_limit` value.  
   - The value is proportionally distributed among multiple running autovacuum workers to ensure their combined limits do not exceed this variable's value.  
   - It can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or server command line but can be overridden for specific tables by altering table storage parameters.  

2. **From `gpt_suggestion`**:  
   - The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` value should be adjusted based on workload and system resources.  
   - A typical starting point is the default value of **200**, but it can be increased (e.g., to **1000-2000**) if autovacuum is too slow.  
   - It is important to monitor I/O and CPU usage to ensure the system is not overwhelmed.  

3. **Contradiction Handling**:  
   - The `manual_suggestion` states the default value is `-1`, while the `gpt_suggestion` mentions a default of **200**. Since the `manual_suggestion` has higher priority, we will retain the default value of `-1`.  

### Comprehensive Suggestion:  
The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` parameter in PostgreSQL sets the cost limit for automatic VACUUM operations, with a default value of `-1`, which uses the `vacuum_cost_limit` value. This value is proportionally distributed among multiple running autovacuum workers to ensure their combined limits do not exceed this variable's value. It can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or server command line but can be overridden for specific tables by altering table storage parameters. To optimize performance, adjust the value based on your workload and system resources. While the default is `-1`, you may consider setting it to a higher value (e.g., **1000-2000**) if autovacuum operations are too slow, but ensure you monitor I/O and CPU usage to avoid overwhelming the system.
