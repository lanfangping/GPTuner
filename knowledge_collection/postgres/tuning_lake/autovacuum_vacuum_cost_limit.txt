### Comprehensive Suggestion:

The `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` parameter in PostgreSQL sets the cost limit for automatic VACUUM operations. By default, it uses the value from the `vacuum_cost_limit` setting and distributes this value proportionally among multiple running autovacuum workers to ensure their combined limits do not exceed the specified value. This parameter can only be configured in the `postgresql.conf` file or via the server command line, but it can be overridden for specific tables by adjusting the table's storage parameters.
