To optimize the performance of automatic VACUUM operations in PostgreSQL, configure the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' parameter. This setting dictates the cost limit shared among autovacuum workers to prevent exceeding the set value when combined. It is adjustable only via the postgresql.conf file or the server command line. However, it can be specifically overridden for individual tables by altering their table storage parameters.
