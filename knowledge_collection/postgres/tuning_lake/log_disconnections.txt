To create a comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information from the three suggestions in the order of manual_suggestion, web_suggestion, and gpt_suggestion. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Manual Suggestion**: This is the highest priority. It states that the `log_disconnections` knob enables logging of session terminations, providing information similar to `log_connections` along with session duration. It can only be altered by superusers at session start and is unchangeable within a session, with its default setting being `off`.

2. **Web Suggestion**: This is the second priority. It suggests that if `log_connections` is turned on, enabling `log_disconnections` can help understand session durations. This aligns with the manual suggestion and adds context about its relationship with `log_connections`.

3. **GPT Suggestion**: This is the lowest priority. It provides additional details about setting `log_disconnections` to `on` for auditing and troubleshooting or to `off` to reduce log volume in high-throughput systems. However, since the manual suggestion already specifies that the default is `off` and it can only be altered at session start, we will prioritize the manual suggestion's details over this.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
Enable the `log_disconnections` knob in PostgreSQL to log session terminations, which provides detailed information similar to `log_connections` along with session duration. This setting is particularly useful for auditing and troubleshooting, especially when `log_connections` is also enabled, as it helps in understanding session durations. Note that `log_disconnections` can only be altered by superusers at the start of a session and is unchangeable within a session. By default, it is set to `off`, but you can set it to `on` in environments requiring detailed session tracking or leave it `off` in high-throughput systems to avoid overwhelming log files.
