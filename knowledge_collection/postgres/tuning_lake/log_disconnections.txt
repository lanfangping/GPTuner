As a suggestion, consider enabling the 'log_disconnections' knob as it logs session terminations, providing information similar to log_connections, including session duration. This feature can only be modified by superusers at the start of a session and remains unchangeable within a session. Its default setting is off. If you decide to turn on 'log_connections', it would be beneficial to also enable 'log_disconnections' for a comprehensive understanding of session durations.
