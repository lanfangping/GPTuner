**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

The `autovacuum_work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL specifies the maximum memory that each autovacuum worker process can use. By default, it is set to a value that causes the setting of `maintenance_work_mem` to be used instead. This setting does not influence the behavior of the `VACUUM` command when executed in contexts other than autovacuum.
