To set the `log_timezone` knob in PostgreSQL, configure it in the `postgresql.conf` file to define the cluster-wide time zone for timestamps in server logs. By default, this setting aligns with the system environment during `initdb` and defaults to GMT unless explicitly overridden. You can specify the desired time zone (e.g., `'UTC'`, `'America/New_York'`, or `'Europe/Berlin'`) in the configuration file or via the `SET` command, ensuring it matches your server's operational time zone. For example, use `log_timezone = 'UTC'` for Coordinated Universal Time. This approach ensures consistency and alignment with your server's time zone requirements.
