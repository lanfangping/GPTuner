Suggestion: The 'max_parallel_workers' parameter in Postgres sets the limit for parallel operation workers in the system, with a default value of 8. When adjusting this value, consider the number of CPU cores your system has, typically setting it to the number of cores or less to avoid increased CPU contention. Also, any changes to this value should be accompanied by adjustments to 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers' and 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather', which are limited by this parameter. However, bear in mind that any value exceeding 'max_worker_processes' will be ineffective.
