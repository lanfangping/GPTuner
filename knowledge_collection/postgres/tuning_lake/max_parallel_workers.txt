To create a comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information from the three suggestions in the order of `manual_suggestion`, `web_suggestion`, and `gpt_suggestion`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Manual Suggestion (Highest Priority)**:
   - The `max_parallel_workers` knob sets the limit for parallel operation workers in PostgreSQL, with a default value of 8.
   - Changes to this value should be accompanied by adjustments to `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` and `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`.
   - Any value exceeding `max_worker_processes` will be ineffective.

2. **Web Suggestion (Medium Priority)**:
   - Adjust `max_parallel_workers` in relation to `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`, as the latter is limited by the former.

3. **GPT Suggestion (Lowest Priority)**:
   - Set `max_parallel_workers` to a value equal to or less than the number of CPU cores available (e.g., 4 for a 4-core system).
   - Ensure it aligns with the workload and does not exceed `max_worker_processes`.
   - Start with 2-4 workers for moderate workloads and scale up based on performance testing.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `max_parallel_workers` knob in PostgreSQL sets the limit for parallel operation workers, with a default value of 8. When adjusting this parameter, ensure the value does not exceed `max_worker_processes`, as any value beyond this limit will be ineffective. Additionally, changes to `max_parallel_workers` should be accompanied by adjustments to `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` and `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`, as these parameters are interdependent. For optimal performance, set `max_parallel_workers` to a value equal to or less than the number of CPU cores available (e.g., 4 for a 4-core system), starting with 2-4 workers for moderate workloads and scaling up based on performance testing. Always ensure the configuration aligns with your workload requirements.
