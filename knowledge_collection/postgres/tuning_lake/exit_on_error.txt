Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Priority Analysis**:
   - The `manual_suggestion` has the highest priority, followed by `web_suggestion`, and then `gpt_suggestion`.
   - The `web_suggestion` is `None`, so it doesn't contribute any information.
   - The `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion` both discuss the `exit_on_error` knob in PostgreSQL but provide slightly different details.

2. **Contradictions and Overlaps**:
   - Both suggestions agree that the `exit_on_error` knob can be set to terminate the session upon encountering errors.
   - The `manual_suggestion` specifies that, by default, the knob is set to `off`, meaning only FATAL errors cause session termination.
   - The `gpt_suggestion` adds that setting the knob to `on` enables strict error handling, while setting it to `off` allows fault tolerance.

3. **Resolution**:
   - Since the `manual_suggestion` has higher priority, its information about the default behavior (`off`) should be retained.
   - The additional context from the `gpt_suggestion` about the implications of setting the knob to `on` or `off` can be incorporated, as it doesn't contradict the `manual_suggestion`.

4. **Final Comprehensive Suggestion**:
   - Enable the `exit_on_error` knob in PostgreSQL to `on` if strict error handling is desired, which will terminate the session immediately upon encountering any error. By default, the knob is set to `off`, meaning only FATAL errors will cause session termination, allowing the session to continue processing despite non-fatal errors for fault tolerance. Choose the setting based on your preference for strict error handling or fault tolerance.

This summary combines the key points from both suggestions while prioritizing the information from the `manual_suggestion`.
