To set the `min_wal_size` knob in PostgreSQL, allocate a value that ensures it is large enough to handle spikes in WAL usage, such as during large batch jobs, while avoiding frequent WAL segment recycling. The default value is often too low, so it is recommended to raise it to **1GB** for high-write workloads or systems without significant disk space restrictions. This setting helps recycle old WAL files for future use at checkpoints when WAL disk usage stays below this threshold, balancing performance and disk usage effectively.
