To fine-tune the performance of PostgreSQL, adjust the 'maintenance_work_mem' setting to manage memory usage during maintenance operations such as VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY. This parameter, by default set at 64MB, can be significantly increased based on your database size and available RAM resources to hasten maintenance tasks. However, be cautious and avoid setting it excessively high to prevent excessive memory allocation during autovacuum operations, keeping in mind that it may allocate memory up to the number of times specified by 'autovacuum_max_workers'. This configuration helps in balancing performance and resource utilization effectively.
