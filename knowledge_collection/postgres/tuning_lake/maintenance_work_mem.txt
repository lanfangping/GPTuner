To create a comprehensive suggestion based on the three provided suggestions, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), `web_suggestion`, and `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). We will integrate the details while resolving any contradictions by favoring the higher-priority suggestion.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `maintenance_work_mem` setting in PostgreSQL controls the maximum memory allocated for maintenance operations such as `VACUUM`, `CREATE INDEX`, and `ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY`. By default, it is set to 64MB, but increasing this value can significantly improve the performance of these operations, especially on systems with large RAM resources and high write activity. However, care must be taken not to set it too high, as each autovacuum worker can use up to this amount of memory, potentially leading to excessive memory allocation when multiplied by `autovacuum_max_workers`. For optimal performance, consider setting `maintenance_work_mem` to a value larger than `work_mem` but within a reasonable range (e.g., 10% of total system memory, typically between 64MB and 1GB, depending on workload and available RAM). This adjustment will speed up maintenance tasks while avoiding unnecessary memory overcommitment.

This summary integrates the key points from all three suggestions, prioritizing the `manual_suggestion` for conflicting details and ensuring clarity and practicality.
