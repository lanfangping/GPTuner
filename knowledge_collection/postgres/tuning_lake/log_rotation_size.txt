### Comprehensive Suggestion:
To effectively manage PostgreSQL log files, enable the `logging_collector` and configure the `log_rotation_size` knob. This parameter sets the maximum size of an individual log file, defaulting to **10 megabytes**. Once this size limit is reached, a new log file is created. You can adjust this setting in the `postgresql.conf` file or via the server command line. For optimal performance, consider setting the `log_rotation_size` to a value like **10240kB** or **20480kB** to balance between manageable file sizes and avoiding excessive log fragmentation, ensuring logs are retained for troubleshooting and auditing purposes. Additionally, click on any parameter in the configuration file to access helpful tips and guidance on tuning it. 

This approach ensures proper log management while leveraging available tools and documentation for further customization.
