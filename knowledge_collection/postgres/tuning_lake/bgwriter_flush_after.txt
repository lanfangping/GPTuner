As a suggestion, consider adjusting the 'bgwriter_flush_after' knob in PostgreSQL. This feature attempts to compel the operating system to issue writes to the underlying storage when the background writer has written more than a specified amount of data. While this can potentially reduce transaction latency, it may also degrade performance in certain scenarios. The default value is set at 512kB on Linux and 0 elsewhere. Please note that this setting can only be modified in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.
