To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), followed by `web_suggestion` (not applicable here), and then `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). Since there is no contradictory information, we will combine the details from the `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion` to create a unified recommendation.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `standard_conforming_strings` parameter in PostgreSQL, which defaults to `on` since version 9.1 (prior versions defaulted to `off`), controls how backslashes (`\\`) are treated in string literals. When set to `on`, backslashes in ordinary string literals ('...') are treated literally, adhering to the SQL standard, and escape string syntax (E'...') must be used if backslashes are needed as escape characters. If your application requires compatibility with older PostgreSQL versions (pre-9.1), you may need to set this parameter to `off` to treat backslashes as regular characters. Adjust this setting based on your application's specific compatibility and functionality needs.
