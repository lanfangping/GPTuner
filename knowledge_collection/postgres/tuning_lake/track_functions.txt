As a suggestion, consider using the 'track_functions' knob to enable tracking of function call counts and time used. This feature provides options to track only procedural-language functions ('pl'), SQL and C language functions ('all'), or disable function statistics tracking ('none' - the default setting). However, please note that this setting can only be changed by superusers and simple SQL-language functions inlined into the calling query are not tracked.
