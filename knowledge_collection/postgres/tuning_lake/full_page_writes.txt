### Comprehensive Suggestion:

In PostgreSQL, the `full_page_writes` knob should be set to `on` to ensure data integrity, especially in scenarios involving older versions (pre-9.x) or less reliable storage systems. When this knob is enabled, it writes the entire content of each disk page to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) during the first modification after a checkpoint, which helps prevent data corruption in the event of a system crash. However, this increases the amount of data written to WAL, potentially impacting performance. If using a file system with robust write-ahead logging (WAL) protection, such as ZFS, it may be acceptable to set `full_page_writes` to `off` to reduce WAL volume and improve performance, but this should be done cautiously to avoid any risk of data corruption.
