I suggest adjusting the 'full_page_writes' setting in PostgreSQL. When enabled, it writes the entire content of each disk page to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) during the first modification after a checkpoint. This ensures data integrity in the event of a system crash, but it also increases the amount of data written to WAL. If you disable it, you may experience faster normal operation, but be aware that this could potentially risk data corruption.
