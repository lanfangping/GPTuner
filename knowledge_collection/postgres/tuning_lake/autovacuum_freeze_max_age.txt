Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to set the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' in postgres at server start. This knob specifies the maximum age, in transactions, that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can reach before a VACUUM operation is automatically initiated. This is to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. However, ensure that the value does not exceed 200,000,000 to avoid potential issues.
