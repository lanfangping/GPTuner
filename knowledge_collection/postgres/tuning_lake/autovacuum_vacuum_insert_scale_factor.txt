To optimize the performance of your PostgreSQL database, adjust the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' parameter. This setting determines a fraction of the table size, defaulting to 20%, and is added to the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' to decide when to trigger a VACUUM. You can modify this value in the postgresql.conf file or directly on the server command line. Additionally, it's possible to override this setting for individual tables based on specific needs.
