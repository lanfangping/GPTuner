**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

The `work_mem` parameter sets the base maximum memory to be used by a query operation, such as a sort or hash table, before writing to temporary disk files. It's crucial to monitor memory usage in your queries, as setting this value too low may cause the engine to use both memory and disk, impacting performance. Conversely, setting it too high could destabilize node throughput when dealing with many concurrent operations. For OLTP queries that do not require complex joins or sorting large datasets, this value may be in the low kBs. For OLAP-style queries with fewer concurrent queries, it may increase into the MB range. To estimate the maximum memory potential consumed by the Postgres process, multiply `work_mem` by `max_connections` times a small single-digit number (N). Adjust this value based on your specific workload and memory availability. If possible, consider raising the default value of `work_mem` to at least 1-5% of your system's RAM.
