To optimize your Postgres performance, adjust the 'work_mem' knob, which sets the base maximum memory to be used by a query operation before writing to temporary disk files. The default value is four megabytes (4MB), but remember that the total memory used could be many times the value of work_mem due to parallel or concurrent operations. To set this parameter, estimate the maximum number of concurrent connections and divide the available memory by this number. However, be cautious not to set it too high to avoid out-of-memory errors. Also, consider the nature of your queries. For OLTP queries that do not require complex joins or sorting lots of data, this value may be in the low MBs. For OLAP-style queries, and few concurrent queries, it may grow into the GB range. Multiply by max_connections * N (being N a small single-digit number) to estimate the maximum amount of total memory potentially consumed by the Postgres process. Adjust based on these considerations to ensure optimal performance and stability.
