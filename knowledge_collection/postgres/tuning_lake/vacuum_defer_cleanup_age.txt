The 'vacuum_defer_cleanup_age' knob in Postgres is designed to specify the number of transactions that VACUUM and HOT updates will delay cleanup of dead row versions. The default value is zero transactions, which allows for immediate removal of dead row versions. However, this value can be increased to provide more time for queries on standby servers to complete. Please note that the exact amount of additional time is unpredictable as it depends on the number of write transactions on the primary server.
