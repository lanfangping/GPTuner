Suggestion: Adjust the 'effective_io_concurrency' setting in PostgreSQL to optimize the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that can be performed simultaneously. This setting is crucial for enhancing performance during bitmap heap scans. The optimal value for 'effective_io_concurrency' should be determined based on the specific type of storage, the characteristics of your database workload, and the operating systemâ€™s support for the posix_fadvise function.
