Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Priority Analysis**:
   - The `manual_suggestion` has the highest priority, followed by `web_suggestion` (which is `None` in this case), and then `gpt_suggestion`.
   - Since `web_suggestion` is `None`, we only need to consider `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`.

2. **Contradictions**:
   - There are no direct contradictions between the `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`. The `manual_suggestion` provides a basic explanation of the `enable_mergejoin` knob, while the `gpt_suggestion` offers more detailed guidance on when to enable or disable it.

3. **Combining Information**:
   - The `manual_suggestion` states that the `enable_mergejoin` knob controls the query planner's use of merge-join plan types, with the default setting being `on`.
   - The `gpt_suggestion` adds that you should set `enable_mergejoin` to `on` if merge joins are frequently beneficial for your workload, particularly for large, sorted datasets. Conversely, you can set it to `off` if merge joins are rarely used and you want to prioritize other join methods like nested loops or hash joins, based on query performance analysis and execution plans.

4. **Final Comprehensive Suggestion**:
   - The `enable_mergejoin` knob allows you to control the query planner's use of merge-join plan types, with the default setting being `on`. You should set `enable_mergejoin` to `on` if merge joins are frequently beneficial for your workload, especially for large, sorted datasets. However, if merge joins are rarely used and you want to prioritize other join methods like nested loops or hash joins, you can set it to `off` based on query performance analysis and execution plans.

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "suggestion": "The 'enable_mergejoin' knob controls the query planner's use of merge-join plan types, with the default setting being 'on'. Set 'enable_mergejoin' to 'on' if merge joins are frequently beneficial for your workload, particularly for large, sorted datasets. If merge joins are rarely used and you want to prioritize other join methods like nested loops or hash joins, set it to 'off' based on query performance analysis and execution plans."
