{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: cpu_operator_cost. 2. Determine if cpu_operator_cost has a natural order and if it can be set to values that significantly alter its function, such as disabling a feature. 3. Research or recall if cpu_operator_cost has any special values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior fundamentally. 4. Conclude whether cpu_operator_cost is a 'special knob' based on the presence of such special values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
