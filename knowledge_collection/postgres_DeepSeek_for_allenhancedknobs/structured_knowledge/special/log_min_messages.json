{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'log_min_messages' in PostgreSQL. 2. Understand its purpose: it controls which message levels are written to the server log. 3. Recognize that it accepts numerical values corresponding to different log levels (e.g., DEBUG5, DEBUG4, ..., LOG, FATAL, PANIC). 4. Note that it also accepts special values like 'none' to disable logging. 5. Determine if the knob has a special value that breaks the natural order of numerical values and performs a different function. 6. Conclude that 'none' is a special value for 'log_min_messages' as it disables logging, which is a different function from setting a specific log level.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "none"}
