{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: shared_buffers. 2. Determine if shared_buffers has a natural order and if it can be set to values that represent a special condition, such as disabling a feature or indicating an unlimited setting. 3. Research or recall that shared_buffers in PostgreSQL is used to define the amount of memory allocated for caching data. 4. Recognize that shared_buffers does not have a special value like -1 or 0 that changes its fundamental behavior; it is always expected to be a positive integer representing the number of 8KB blocks. 5. Conclude that shared_buffers does not qualify as a 'special knob' because it lacks a special value that alters its operation in a significant way.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
