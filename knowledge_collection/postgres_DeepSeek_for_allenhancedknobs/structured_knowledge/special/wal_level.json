{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'wal_level'. 2. Understand the function of 'wal_level' in PostgreSQL, which controls the amount of information written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL). 3. Research if 'wal_level' has any special values that alter its behavior significantly from its regular numerical settings. 4. Determine if setting 'wal_level' to a specific value (e.g., 'minimal', 'replica', 'logical') changes its function in a way that is not a simple numerical adjustment. 5. Conclude whether 'wal_level' is a 'special knob' based on the presence of such special values.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "minimal"}
