    "think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: max_parallel_workers_per_gather. 2. Determine if this knob has a natural numerical order, which it does, as it sets the maximum number of parallel workers that can be started by a single Gather node. 3. Check if there are any special values that this knob can take which would alter its function significantly from its regular operation. 4. Upon research, it is found that setting max_parallel_workers_per_gather to 0 disables parallel query execution for the session, which is a significant deviation from its regular function of limiting the number of parallel workers. 5. Conclude that max_parallel_workers_per_gather is a special knob due to the presence of a special value (0) that changes its function.",
