{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'log_min_duration_statement'. 2. Understand its function: This setting in PostgreSQL controls the minimum execution time above which statements will be logged. 3. Determine if it has a special value: The value '-1' is used to disable logging of all statements, regardless of their execution time. 4. Compare with regular operation: Normally, this knob takes a positive integer representing milliseconds, but '-1' serves a special function. 5. Conclude if it's a special knob based on the presence of a special value that alters its function significantly.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
