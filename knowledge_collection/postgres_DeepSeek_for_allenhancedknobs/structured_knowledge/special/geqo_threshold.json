{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: geqo_threshold. 2. Research the function of geqo_threshold in PostgreSQL. 3. Determine if geqo_threshold has any special values that alter its behavior significantly from its regular numerical operation. 4. If such a special value exists, classify geqo_threshold as a 'special knob' and note the special value. 5. If no such special value exists, classify geqo_threshold as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": "true", "special_value": "0"}
