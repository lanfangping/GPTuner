{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: max_locks_per_transaction. 2. Determine if this knob has a natural numerical order, which it does, as it controls the maximum number of locks that can be held by a single transaction. 3. Check if there are any special values that break this natural order and perform a different function. In the case of max_locks_per_transaction, setting it to a very high value or a specific value like -1 or 0 does not disable the feature or perform a significantly different function; it simply adjusts the limit. 4. Conclude that max_locks_per_transaction does not have special values that break its natural order for a different function.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
