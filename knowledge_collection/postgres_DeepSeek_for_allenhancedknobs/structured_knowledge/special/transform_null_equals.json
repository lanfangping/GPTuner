{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'transform_null_equals' in PostgreSQL. 2. Determine if this knob has a special value that alters its function significantly from its regular numerical operation. 3. Research or recall that 'transform_null_equals' is a boolean knob, not numerical, hence it does not have numerical values that could be considered 'special' in the context of breaking a natural order. 4. Conclude that since 'transform_null_equals' does not have numerical values with special meanings, it cannot be classified as a 'special knob' as defined.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
