{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: 'client_min_messages'. 2. Determine if 'client_min_messages' has a natural order and if it includes any special values that deviate from this order. 3. Research or recall that 'client_min_messages' controls which message levels are sent to the client. 4. Recognize that while it primarily accepts levels like 'debug5', 'debug', 'info', 'notice', 'warning', 'error', 'log', 'fatal', and 'panic', it does not inherently have a numerical order or special numerical values like -1 or 0 that perform a completely different function. 5. Conclude that 'client_min_messages' does not fit the definition of a 'special knob' as it lacks special numerical values that break its natural order and perform a different function.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
