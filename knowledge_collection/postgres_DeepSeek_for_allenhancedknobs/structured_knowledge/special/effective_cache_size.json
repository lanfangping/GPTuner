{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: effective_cache_size. 2. Determine if effective_cache_size has a natural order, which it does, as it represents the amount of memory available for caching data. 3. Check if effective_cache_size has any special values that break this natural order and perform a different function. 4. Upon research, it is found that effective_cache_size does not have special values like -1 or 0 that disable its function or perform a significantly different operation. It is used to estimate the size of the disk cache available to a single query. 5. Conclude that effective_cache_size is not a 'special knob' as it does not have special values that break its natural order or perform a different function.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
