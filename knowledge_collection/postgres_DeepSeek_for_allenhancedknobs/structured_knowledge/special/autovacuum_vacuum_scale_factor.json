{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor. 2. Determine if this knob has a natural order and if it can take on values that significantly alter its function. 3. Research or recall if autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor has any special values that change its behavior fundamentally, such as disabling a feature or enabling a special mode. 4. Conclude based on the findings whether autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor is a 'special knob' and identify any special values it may have.", "special_knob": "false", "special_value": "null"}
