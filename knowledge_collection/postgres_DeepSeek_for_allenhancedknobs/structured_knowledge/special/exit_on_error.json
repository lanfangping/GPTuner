{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'exit_on_error' in PostgreSQL. 2. Determine if 'exit_on_error' has a natural numerical order or if it includes special values that alter its behavior significantly. 3. Research or recall that 'exit_on_error' is a boolean knob, not numerical, thus it does not have a natural numerical order or special numerical values. 4. Conclude that 'exit_on_error' does not qualify as a 'special knob' as defined, since it does not have special numerical values that break a natural order.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
