To set the `max_wal_size` knob in PostgreSQL, it is recommended to allocate a size that ensures automatic checkpoints are primarily triggered by timeout rather than disk space constraints. The default soft limit is 1 GB, but this can be adjusted based on workload size, starting with 1 GB for small workloads and scaling up to 16 GB or more for large databases. Ensure the value is at least 10% of the total data size to avoid frequent checkpointing. Increasing this value may extend the time required for crash recovery, so it should be balanced with recovery time considerations. This approach prioritizes performance and stability while accounting for workload demands and recovery implications.
