To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), `web_suggestion` (middle priority), and `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). Since the `web_suggestion` is `None`, we will focus on the `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`. The `manual_suggestion` provides the most critical details, so we will use it as the foundation and incorporate any non-contradictory information from the `gpt_suggestion`.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `transform_null_equals` knob in PostgreSQL, when enabled (default is off), treats `expr = NULL` as `expr IS NULL`, returning `true` if `expr` is null and `false` otherwise. This behavior deviates from the SQL-standard behavior, where `expr = NULL` always returns `null`. Enabling this option (`SET transform_null_equals = on;`) is primarily useful for compatibility with Microsoft Access queries but has minimal impact on normal applications. If you need to revert to the legacy behavior, you can disable it by setting `transform_null_equals = off;`. Note that this option is not typically necessary for standard PostgreSQL usage and is mainly intended for specific compatibility scenarios.
