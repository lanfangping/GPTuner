To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), `web_suggestion` (middle priority), and `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). Since the `web_suggestion` is `None`, we will focus on the `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`. 

The `manual_suggestion` provides the foundational information about the `autovacuum_max_workers` parameter, stating that it sets the limit for autovacuum processes that can run simultaneously, with a default setting of three, and that this parameter can only be adjusted at server startup. The `gpt_suggestion` adds context about how to set the value of `autovacuum_max_workers` based on the number of CPU cores, but this information is secondary to the manual suggestion.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `autovacuum_max_workers` parameter sets the limit for the number of autovacuum processes that can run simultaneously, with a default value of three. This parameter can only be adjusted at server startup. When configuring this parameter, consider the number of CPU cores available in your system. For systems with 4-8 cores, starting with 1-3 workers is typical, while larger systems with 16+ cores may benefit from increasing the number of workers up to 5-8. However, ensure that the value does not exceed the total number of tables requiring vacuuming or cause excessive resource contention. Always prioritize server stability and performance when making adjustments.
