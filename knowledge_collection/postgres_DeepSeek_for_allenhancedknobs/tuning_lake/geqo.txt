To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), `web_suggestion` (middle priority, but it is `None` in this case), and `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). Since there is no contradictory information, we will combine the details from the `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion` to create a unified suggestion.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `geqo` knob in PostgreSQL controls the Genetic Query Optimizer and is typically left enabled (`on`) in production environments to improve query optimization performance, especially for complex queries involving many joins. The `geqo_threshold` parameter (default: 12) allows for more granular control by specifying the number of joins at which GEQO is activated. For simpler queries or when deterministic planning is preferred, GEQO can be disabled (`off`). Adjusting the `geqo_threshold` can help tailor the optimizer's behavior to specific workload requirements.
