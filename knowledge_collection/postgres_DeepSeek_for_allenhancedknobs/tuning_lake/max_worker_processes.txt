To create a comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information from the `manual_suggestion`, followed by the `web_suggestion`, and finally the `gpt_suggestion`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Manual Suggestion (Highest Priority):**  
   - The `max_worker_processes` parameter sets the maximum number of background processes the system can support.  
   - It can only be set at server start and has a default value of 8.  
   - On a standby server, it should be the same or higher than on the master server to allow queries.  

2. **Web Suggestion (Medium Priority):**  
   - A general guideline is to set `max_worker_processes` to 75% to 90% of the number of CPU cores, especially for systems with high core counts.  
   - A more detailed approach involves calculating the sum of all worker parameters.  

3. **GPT Suggestion (Lowest Priority):**  
   - Set `max_worker_processes` to a value equal to or slightly higher than the number of CPU cores (e.g., 8 for an 8-core system).  
   - Ensure the value aligns with the workload's parallelism needs while leaving room for other processes.  

### Comprehensive Suggestion:  
The `max_worker_processes` parameter determines the maximum number of background processes the system can support and must be set at server start, with a default value of 8. To optimize performance, set it to 75% to 90% of the number of CPU cores, particularly for systems with high core counts. Alternatively, calculate the sum of all worker parameters for a more precise configuration. Ensure the value aligns with the workload's parallelism needs while leaving sufficient resources for other processes. On a standby server, set `max_worker_processes` to the same or higher value as on the master server to ensure query execution capability.  

This summary incorporates the key points from all three suggestions while prioritizing the `manual_suggestion` and resolving any contradictions.
