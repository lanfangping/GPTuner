To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: **manual_suggestion** (highest priority), **web_suggestion** (medium priority), and **gpt_suggestion** (lowest priority). We will integrate the key points while resolving any contradictions based on priority.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `bgwriter_lru_maxpages` parameter in PostgreSQL controls the maximum number of buffers that the background writer can write in each round. This parameter can be configured in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line. To optimize its value, consider the following guidelines:
- For **light workloads**, start with 100-200 pages (800KB-1.6MB).
- For **moderate workloads**, use 500-1000 pages (4MB-8MB).
- For **heavy workloads**, adjust the value up to 2000-5000 pages (16MB-40MB), while monitoring performance and I/O to fine-tune the setting.
- If the database is particularly busy, increasing this value can further enhance the activity of the background writer.
- Note that setting the value to **zero** disables background writing entirely.

This approach ensures that the configuration aligns with the workload type and system resources, while leveraging the background writer's capabilities to improve database performance.
