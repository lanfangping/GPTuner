To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), `web_suggestion`, and `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). We will retain the most critical details from the highest-priority suggestion and incorporate additional relevant information from the lower-priority suggestions, ensuring no contradictions.

**Comprehensive Suggestion:**

The `log_line_prefix` in PostgreSQL is a powerful configuration option that allows you to customize the information logged at the start of each log line. It uses a printf-style string format, where `%` characters are replaced with status information. By default, it is set to `'%m [%p] '`, which logs a timestamp (`%m`) and the process ID (`%p`). You can configure this setting in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line. To enrich your logs further, consider adding additional escape sequences such as `%u` for the username, `%d` for the database name, `%a` for the application name, or `%h` for the host IP, depending on your specific needs. If you plan to use external log processing tools like PgBadger, ensure your `log_line_prefix` format is compatible with the tool by consulting its documentation. This approach ensures detailed, traceable, and tool-compatible logging.
