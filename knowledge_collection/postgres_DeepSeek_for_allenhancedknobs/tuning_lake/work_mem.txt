To create a comprehensive suggestion based on the three provided suggestions, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), `web_suggestion` (medium priority), and `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). We will integrate the key points from each suggestion, resolving any contradictions by favoring the higher-priority source.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `work_mem` parameter in PostgreSQL controls the maximum memory allocated for query operations like sorts or hash tables before resorting to temporary disk files. The default value is 4MB, which is generally considered too small for modern systems. To optimize performance, adjust `work_mem` based on your system's available memory, workload type, and concurrency. For light workloads, start with 16MB as a baseline, as suggested by experts like Christophe Pettus. For moderate workloads, consider values in the range of 128MB-256MB, and for memory-intensive operations (e.g., large joins or sorts), increase it to 512MB-1GB. However, ensure that the total memory usage (`work_mem` Ã— concurrent operations) does not exceed 25-50% of the system's total RAM to avoid destabilizing the node throughput. For OLTP queries with simple operations, smaller values (low MBs) may suffice, while OLAP-style queries with fewer concurrent operations may require values in the GB range. Always monitor query performance and adjust `work_mem` dynamically to balance memory usage and system stability.
