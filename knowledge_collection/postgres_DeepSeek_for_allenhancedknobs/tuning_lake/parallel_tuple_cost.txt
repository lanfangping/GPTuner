To set the value for the `parallel_tuple_cost` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on the overhead of transferring tuples between parallel workers. The default value is **0.1**, which represents the planner's estimated cost of transferring a single tuple from one parallel worker process to another. If parallel queries are slower than expected, consider increasing the value (e.g., to **0.2** or higher). Conversely, if the system is underutilizing parallelism due to high perceived costs, decrease the value (e.g., to **0.05**). This approach ensures optimal performance by balancing the cost of tuple transfer with the benefits of parallel execution.
