To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: **manual_suggestion** (highest priority), **web_suggestion** (medium priority), and **gpt_suggestion** (lowest priority). We will resolve any contradictions by favoring the higher-priority suggestion.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `checkpoint_timeout` parameter in PostgreSQL controls the maximum time between automatic WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) checkpoints, with a **default setting of five minutes (300 seconds)**. Adjusting this parameter can significantly impact crash recovery time and I/O overhead. Increasing the `checkpoint_timeout` (e.g., to 15 minutes or more) can reduce I/O spikes and improve overall I/O usage, as it allows checkpoints to occur less frequently. However, this may result in longer recovery times after a database crash. Conversely, shorter values (e.g., 5 minutes) reduce recovery time but increase I/O overhead due to more frequent checkpoints. To optimize performance, consider balancing `checkpoint_timeout` with other related parameters like `checkpoint_completion_target` and `bgwriter` activity to smooth out I/O spikes and achieve a balance between recovery time and system performance.
