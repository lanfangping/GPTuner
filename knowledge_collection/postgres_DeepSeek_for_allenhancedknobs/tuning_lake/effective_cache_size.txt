To create a comprehensive suggestion based on the three provided suggestions, we will prioritize the information in the order of `manual_suggestion`, `web_suggestion`, and `gpt_suggestion`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Manual Suggestion (Highest Priority)**:
   - The `effective_cache_size` parameter influences the planner's assumption about the size of the disk cache available to a single query, affecting the choice between index or sequential scans.
   - It considers both PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel's disk cache for PostgreSQL data files.
   - It does not affect the size of shared memory allocated by PostgreSQL or reserve kernel disk cache.
   - The default value is 4GB, and if specified without units, it is taken as blocks (typically 8kB).

2. **Web Suggestion (Medium Priority)**:
   - The formula `system RAM - (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) * 1.1` can be used to calculate the value, or a lower value if the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL.
   - This setting does not affect the amount of physical RAM used by queries.

3. **GPT Suggestion (Lowest Priority)**:
   - Set `effective_cache_size` to approximately 70-80% of the total available RAM for the system (e.g., 11-13GB for a 16GB system).
   - This parameter estimates the portion of memory available for disk caching.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `effective_cache_size` parameter sets the planner's assumption about the size of the disk cache available to a single query, influencing the choice between index or sequential scans. It considers both PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel's disk cache for PostgreSQL data files, without affecting the size of shared memory allocated by PostgreSQL or reserving kernel disk cache. The default value is 4GB, and if specified without units, it is taken as blocks (typically 8kB). To calculate a custom value, use the formula: `system RAM - (shared_buffers + work_mem * max_connections * 2) * 1.1`, or set it to a lower value if the server is not dedicated exclusively to PostgreSQL. Alternatively, you can set it to approximately 70-80% of the total available RAM for the system (e.g., 11-13GB for a 16GB system) as a general guideline. Note that this setting does not affect the amount of physical RAM used by queries.
