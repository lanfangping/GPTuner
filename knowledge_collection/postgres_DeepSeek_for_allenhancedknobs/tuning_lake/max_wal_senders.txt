To create a comprehensive suggestion based on the provided JSON, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), followed by `web_suggestion` (not applicable here), and finally `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). Since there is no contradictory information, we will combine the details from `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion` into a single, cohesive suggestion.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `max_wal_senders` parameter in PostgreSQL determines the maximum number of concurrent connections from standby servers or streaming base backup clients. It should be set slightly higher than the maximum number of expected clients to accommodate immediate reconnections in case of abrupt disconnections. For example, if you have 3 replicas, set it to 5-8 to allow for additional connections or future scaling. This parameter can only be configured at server start and requires the `wal_level` to be set to `replica` or higher. The default value is 10, but adjusting it based on your specific replication and backup needs is recommended for optimal performance and scalability.
