To create a comprehensive suggestion based on the three provided suggestions, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), `web_suggestion`, and `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). We will integrate the details from all three suggestions while resolving any contradictions in favor of the higher-priority suggestion.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
To configure WAL archiving in PostgreSQL, enable the `archive_mode` knob by setting it to `on` or `always`, depending on your use case. This ensures that completed WAL segments are archived to a specified location using the `archive_command`. For example, `archive_command = 'cp %p /path/to/archive/%f'` copies WAL files to `/path/to/archive/`. 

- **Modes**: 
  - Use `on` for standard archiving, which archives WAL files during normal operation.
  - Use `always` if you need to archive WAL files even during archive recovery or standby mode, such as in logical replication setups.

- **Configuration**: 
  - The `archive_mode` parameter can only be set at server start and cannot be enabled if `wal_level` is set to `minimal`.
  - Ensure the `archive_command` is properly configured to handle the archiving process.

- **Recommendations**:
  - Enable archiving in environments requiring backups and data consistency, such as production systems.
  - Disable archiving (`archive_mode = off`) for non-critical databases (e.g., testing environments) to minimize storage usage and avoid unnecessary overhead.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure efficient WAL archiving tailored to your database's operational needs.
