To create a comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information from the `manual_suggestion`, followed by the `web_suggestion`, and finally the `gpt_suggestion`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Priority 1: `manual_suggestion`**  
   - The `shared_buffers` knob controls memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers.  
   - The default value is 128MB.  
   - For servers with 1GB or more RAM, it is reasonable to set `shared_buffers` to **25% of system memory**, but not more than **40%**.  
   - For systems with less than 1GB RAM, a smaller percentage should be used.  

2. **Priority 2: `web_suggestion`**  
   - Conventional wisdom suggests 25% of RAM, but benchmarks should be performed to fine-tune this parameter.  
   - For systems with hundreds of GBs of RAM, consider setting up huge pages.  
   - Adjust the parameter for non-dedicated servers, as each PostgreSQL instance reserves its own memory allocations.  
   - The `shared_buffers` setting is directly related to OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall`.  

3. **Priority 3: `gpt_suggestion`**  
   - Recommends setting `shared_buffers` to approximately **25% of total system RAM** for dedicated database servers (e.g., 8GB for a 32GB system).  
   - Ensures it does not exceed **40% of RAM** to leave sufficient memory for other processes like the operating system and disk caching.  

### Comprehensive Suggestion:  
The `shared_buffers` knob in PostgreSQL controls the memory used by the database server for shared memory buffers, with a default value of 128MB. For servers with 1GB or more RAM, it is recommended to set `shared_buffers` to **25% of system memory**, but not exceeding **40%** to ensure sufficient memory is available for the operating system and other processes. For systems with less than 1GB RAM, a smaller percentage should be used.  

For dedicated database servers, benchmarks should be performed to fine-tune this parameter, especially for systems with hundreds of GBs of RAM, where setting up huge pages may be beneficial. On non-dedicated servers, adjust the parameter accordingly, as each PostgreSQL instance reserves its own memory allocations. Additionally, ensure the `shared_buffers` setting aligns with OS kernel parameters `shmmax` and `shmall` for optimal performance.
