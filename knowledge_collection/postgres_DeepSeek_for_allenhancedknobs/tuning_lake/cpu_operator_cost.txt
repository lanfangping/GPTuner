To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), followed by `web_suggestion`, and then `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). Since `web_suggestion` is `None`, we will only consider `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`.

1. **Manual Suggestion**: This provides the foundational understanding that the `cpu_operator_cost` knob in PostgreSQL sets the estimated cost of processing each operator or function during a query. This is the highest-priority information and must be included.

2. **GPT Suggestion**: This adds context about how to set the `cpu_operator_cost` knob based on the relative cost of CPU operations compared to disk I/O, suggesting a typical range of **0.0025 to 0.01**. Lower values favor CPU-intensive queries, while higher values favor disk I/O-heavy operations. This information complements the manual suggestion and can be included as additional guidance.

Since there is no contradiction between the two suggestions, we can combine them into a single comprehensive suggestion.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `cpu_operator_cost` knob in PostgreSQL sets the estimated cost of processing each operator or function during a query. To optimize query performance, set this parameter based on the relative cost of CPU operations compared to disk I/O. A typical range for `cpu_operator_cost` is **0.0025 to 0.01**, where lower values favor CPU-intensive queries and higher values favor disk I/O-heavy operations. Adjust this parameter according to your workload characteristics to achieve optimal query execution plans.
