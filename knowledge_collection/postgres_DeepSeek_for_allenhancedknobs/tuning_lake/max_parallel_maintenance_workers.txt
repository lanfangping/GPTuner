To create a comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information from the `manual_suggestion` first, followed by the `gpt_suggestion`, and ignore the `web_suggestion` as it is `None`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Manual Suggestion**: This provides the foundational understanding of the `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` parameter, explaining its purpose (to set the maximum number of parallel workers for utility commands like CREATE INDEX or VACUUM) and noting that setting it to 0 disables parallel workers entirely.

2. **GPT Suggestion**: This provides specific guidance on how to set the value of `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` based on the number of CPU cores. It suggests ranges for different core counts and emphasizes not exceeding the total number of cores minus 1 to avoid overloading the system.

3. **Web Suggestion**: This is `None`, so it does not contribute any additional information.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` parameter in PostgreSQL controls the maximum number of parallel workers that can be used by utility commands such as CREATE INDEX or VACUUM. Setting this value to 0 disables the use of parallel workers entirely. For optimal performance, configure this parameter based on the number of CPU cores available:  
- For systems with 4 or fewer cores, set it to 1-2.  
- For systems with 4-8 cores, set it to 2-4.  
- For systems with more than 8 cores, set it to 4-8.  
Ensure the value does not exceed the total number of cores minus 1 to prevent overloading the system. The actual number of workers used at runtime may be less than the configured value, depending on system conditions.
