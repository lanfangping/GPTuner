To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: **manual_suggestion** (highest priority), **web_suggestion** (middle priority), and **gpt_suggestion** (lowest priority). Since the **web_suggestion** is `None`, we will only consider the **manual_suggestion** and **gpt_suggestion**.

### Step-by-Step Summary:
1. **Manual Suggestion**: This provides a clear explanation of the purpose of the `wal_retrieve_retry_interval` parameter, stating that it specifies the standby server's wait time (in milliseconds) before retrying to retrieve WAL data when it is unavailable from streaming replication, local `pg_wal`, or WAL archive.
2. **GPT Suggestion**: This provides specific recommendations for setting the value of the `wal_retrieve_retry_interval` parameter, suggesting a range between **100ms and 500ms**, with **200ms** as a common default for moderate workloads. It also advises adjusting the value higher (e.g., **500ms**) for high-latency environments or lower (e.g., **100ms**) for faster recovery in low-latency setups.

Since there is no contradiction between the two suggestions, we can combine them into a single comprehensive suggestion.

### Final Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `wal_retrieve_retry_interval` parameter specifies the standby server's wait time (in milliseconds) before retrying to retrieve WAL data when it is unavailable from streaming replication, local `pg_wal`, or WAL archive. To optimize performance, set this parameter to a value between **100ms and 500ms**, with **200ms** being a common default for moderate workloads. For high-latency environments, consider increasing the value to **500ms**, while for low-latency setups requiring faster recovery, a lower value such as **100ms** may be more appropriate.
