To create a comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information from the `manual_suggestion` first, followed by the `gpt_suggestion`, and ignore the `web_suggestion` as it is `None`. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Manual Suggestion**: This provides the foundational understanding of the `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` parameter, explaining that it determines when a VACUUM should be triggered by adding a fraction of the table size to the `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`. It also mentions that the default value is `0.2` (20% of the table size) and can be configured globally in the `postgresql.conf` file or via the server command line, with the ability to override it for individual tables.

2. **GPT Suggestion**: This builds on the manual suggestion by providing guidance on how to adjust the `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` based on the table's update frequency and size. It suggests starting with the default value of `0.2` but recommends lowering it to `0.05` (5%) for heavily updated tables to reduce vacuuming overhead and increasing it to `0.5` (50%) for static tables to balance performance.

3. **Web Suggestion**: Since this is `None`, it does not contribute any additional information.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` parameter determines when a VACUUM operation should be triggered by adding a fraction of the table size to the `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`. The default value is `0.2` (20% of the table size), which can be configured globally in the `postgresql.conf` file or via the server command line, and can also be overridden for individual tables. To optimize performance, adjust this value based on the table's update frequency and size: for heavily updated tables, consider lowering it to `0.05` (5%) to reduce vacuuming overhead, and for static tables, increase it to `0.5` (50%) to balance performance. This approach ensures efficient vacuuming while minimizing unnecessary resource usage.
