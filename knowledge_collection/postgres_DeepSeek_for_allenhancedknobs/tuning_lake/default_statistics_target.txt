To create a comprehensive suggestion based on the three provided inputs, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), `web_suggestion`, and `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). We will combine the key points from each suggestion, resolving any contradictions by favoring the higher-priority source.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `default_statistics_target` knob in PostgreSQL controls the default statistics target for table columns without a column-specific target, with a default value of 100. Increasing this value (e.g., to 200-500 or higher for large systems) can improve the quality of the query planner's estimates, particularly for large or complex tables. However, this comes with trade-offs, including increased time for `ANALYZE` operations and additional storage overhead for statistics. Medium-sized systems typically perform well with values around 200, while larger systems may require values up to 500 or 1000. It is important to carefully evaluate the impact of raising this value, as it can affect both performance and resource usage.
