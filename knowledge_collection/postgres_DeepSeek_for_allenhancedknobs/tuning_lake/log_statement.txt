To set the `log_statement` knob in PostgreSQL, choose one of the following values based on your logging needs: `none` (default, logs nothing), `ddl` (logs only data definition statements like CREATE, ALTER, DROP), `mod` (logs DDL plus data-modifying statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, COPY FROM), or `all` (logs all statements). For example, set it to `mod` to log both schema changes and data modifications. Note that when using the extended query protocol, logging occurs during the Execute phase and includes parameter values. This comprehensive suggestion prioritizes the `manual_suggestion` and incorporates relevant details from the `gpt_suggestion`, while omitting the `web_suggestion` as it is not provided.
