To create a comprehensive suggestion based on the three provided suggestions, we will prioritize the information as follows: **manual_suggestion** (highest priority), **web_suggestion**, and **gpt_suggestion** (lowest priority). We will integrate the details while resolving any contradictions by favoring the higher-priority suggestion.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `hot_standby_feedback` knob in PostgreSQL controls whether a hot standby server sends feedback about executing queries to the primary or upstream standby. Enabling this setting (`on`) can prevent query cancellations on the standby server, which is particularly useful for read-only workloads. However, it may lead to increased database bloat on the primary server due to delayed vacuum cleanup and higher WAL disk space consumption. Feedback is sent no more than once per `wal_receiver_status_interval`, and the default setting is `off`. It is recommended to enable this setting when replication lag is minimal (e.g., under 1 second) and the workload involves frequent updates or deletes, as this minimizes the risk of excessive bloat while ensuring query stability on the standby. Use this setting cautiously, as it can create additional pressure on the primary server.
