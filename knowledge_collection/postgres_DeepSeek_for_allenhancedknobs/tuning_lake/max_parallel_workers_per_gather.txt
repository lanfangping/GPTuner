To create a comprehensive suggestion based on the three provided suggestions, we will prioritize the information as follows: **manual_suggestion** (highest priority), **web_suggestion** (medium priority), and **gpt_suggestion** (lowest priority). We will integrate the key points from each suggestion while resolving any contradictions in favor of the higher-priority suggestion.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` parameter controls the maximum number of parallel workers that can be used by a single Gather or Gather Merge node. The default value is 2, and it is limited by both `max_worker_processes` and `max_parallel_workers`. When configuring this parameter, consider the following:

1. **Workload Type and System Resources**:
   - For **OLTP systems**, keep the value low (1 or 2) to avoid excessive resource contention and inefficiency, as high parallelism can degrade performance in high-throughput transactional systems.
   - For **OLAP or data warehousing systems**, you can increase the value to a fraction of the available CPU cores (e.g., 50-75% of total cores), but ensure it does not exceed `max_parallel_workers` and leaves sufficient resources for other processes.

2. **Resource Utilization and Efficiency**:
   - Be cautious when setting a high value, as the requested number of workers may not always be available at runtime, potentially leading to inefficiency.
   - Parallel queries can significantly increase resource utilization, so monitor and adjust the parameter based on system performance and workload demands.

3. **Interaction with Other Parameters**:
   - This parameter is influenced by `work_mem`, so review and adjust `work_mem` accordingly to ensure optimal performance.

By carefully balancing these considerations, you can optimize the `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` setting to align with your system's workload and resource availability.
