To create a comprehensive suggestion based on the three provided inputs, we will prioritize the information as follows: **manual_suggestion** (highest priority), **web_suggestion**, and **gpt_suggestion** (lowest priority). We will integrate the key points from each suggestion while resolving any contradictions in favor of the higher-priority suggestion.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `logging_collector` parameter in PostgreSQL activates a background process that captures and redirects log messages into log files, ensuring reliable logging even under high load and preventing message loss. This parameter can only be set at server start. It is recommended to set `logging_collector` to `on` to enable logging, as this provides a robust method for log collection and management. However, if you are using an external logging tool or have specific performance constraints, you may consider setting it to `off`. In general, unless you have no need for logs, keeping it enabled (`on`) is advisable for effective log handling. 

This summary combines the technical details from the manual suggestion, the practical advice from the web suggestion, and the conditional guidance from the GPT suggestion, while prioritizing the manual suggestion's information.
