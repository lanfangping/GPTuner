To create a comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: **manual_suggestion** (highest priority), **web_suggestion** (medium priority), and **gpt_suggestion** (lowest priority). We will integrate the details while resolving any contradictions based on priority.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `max_connections` parameter in PostgreSQL determines the maximum number of concurrent connections to the database server. By default, this is typically set to **100**, but it must be adjusted carefully based on your system's configuration and workload. On a standby server, this value must be equal to or higher than the master server's setting, and changes to this parameter require a server restart. 

For optimal performance, consider using **connection pooling**. If using connection pooling in **transaction mode**, set `max_connections` to a low multiple (2-5x) of the number of CPU cores on the server. In **session mode**, set it to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued. If connection pooling is not used, set it to the required number of concurrent users, though performance may be suboptimal without pooling. 

Additionally, ensure that each connection has sufficient memory (e.g., **5-10 MB of RAM** per connection). For systems with limited memory, such as 8 GB RAM, a safe range is **100-200 connections**. Adjust this value higher for lightweight workloads or lower for memory-intensive operations. Always validate the setting against your system's available memory and workload requirements. 

This approach balances system resources, workload demands, and best practices for PostgreSQL configuration.
