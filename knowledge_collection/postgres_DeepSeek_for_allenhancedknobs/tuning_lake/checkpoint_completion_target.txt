To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: **manual_suggestion** (highest priority), **web_suggestion**, and **gpt_suggestion** (lowest priority). We will integrate the key points from each suggestion while resolving any contradictions based on priority.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `checkpoint_completion_target` knob in PostgreSQL is used to set the goal for checkpoint completion as a percentage of the total time between checkpoints. The default setting is **0.5**, and it can only be adjusted in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line. To balance checkpoint I/O load and recovery time, it is recommended to set this value between **0.5 and 0.9**, with **0.7** or **0.8** being commonly used values. Raising this value helps smooth I/O activity over larger periods of time. However, if you rely on this setting for feeding non-streaming replicas, it is advisable to keep it within a low percentage. On development instances, a value of **0.9** is often used. Ensure that checkpoints complete within a reasonable fraction of the checkpoint timeout (default **5 minutes**) to optimize performance. 

This suggestion integrates the configuration method, default value, recommended range, and practical considerations from all three sources while prioritizing the manual_suggestion's emphasis on the configuration process and default value.
