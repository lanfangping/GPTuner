To set the `random_page_cost` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on the type of storage used and the specific characteristics of your workload. The default value is **4.0**, which is suitable for traditional HDDs due to their slower random access speeds. For SSDs, where random access is nearly as fast as sequential access, consider setting the value to **1.0**. If using high-performance NVMe SSDs, a value around **1.5** may be more appropriate. Additionally, fine-tune the setting by considering factors such as the cache rate, the size of the database relative to server memory, and the specific performance profile of your storage system. This approach ensures the planner accurately estimates the cost of non-sequentially-fetched disk pages, optimizing query performance.
