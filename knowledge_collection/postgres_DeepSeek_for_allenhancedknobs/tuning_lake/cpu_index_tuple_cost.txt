To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we prioritize the information as follows: the `manual_suggestion` takes precedence over the `gpt_suggestion`, and the `web_suggestion` is ignored since it is `None`. Here's the consolidated suggestion:

**Suggestion:**  
The `cpu_index_tuple_cost` knob in PostgreSQL is used to adjust the planner's estimated cost of processing each index entry during an index scan, with the default setting being `0.005`. To optimize performance, adjust this value based on your workload: for OLTP systems with frequent index scans, the default value is typically sufficient. For OLAP systems with fewer index scans, consider increasing it slightly (e.g., to `0.01`) to discourage excessive index usage, or decrease it (e.g., to `0.001`) if index scans are underutilized and performance is critical. This adjustment should align with your system's specific requirements and workload characteristics.
