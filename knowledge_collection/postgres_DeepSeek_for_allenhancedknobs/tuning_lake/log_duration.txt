To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` takes precedence over `web_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`. Since `web_suggestion` is `None`, we will focus on integrating the `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `log_duration` knob in PostgreSQL logs the duration of every completed statement, with durations for Parse, Bind, and Execute steps logged independently for extended query protocol clients. By default, it logs all durations without query text. However, if `log_min_duration_statement` is set to a positive value, query text is included only for statements exceeding that threshold. Enabling `log_duration` is useful for debugging slow queries, but it can generate significant log volume in high-traffic environments. Therefore, it is recommended to set `log_duration` to `on` only when necessary for debugging purposes and to carefully manage log storage and retention policies to avoid excessive log accumulation.

This summary combines the detailed logging behavior from the `manual_suggestion` with the practical considerations and default setting from the `gpt_suggestion`, while omitting redundant or lower-priority information.
