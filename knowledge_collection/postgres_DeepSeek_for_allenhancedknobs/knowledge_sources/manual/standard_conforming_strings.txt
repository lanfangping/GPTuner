The `standard_conforming_strings` parameter, defaulting to `on` since PostgreSQL 9.1 (prior versions defaulted to `off`), controls whether backslashes in ordinary string literals ('...') are treated literally, as per the SQL standard, and indicates support for escape string syntax (E'...') when backslashes are needed as escape characters.
