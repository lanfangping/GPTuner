The `log_truncate_on_rotation` parameter, when enabled, overwrites existing log files with the same name during time-based rotation (e.g., 24 hourly files cyclically overwritten for a 24-hour log retention or 7 daily files for a 7-day retention), but does not apply during server startup or size-based rotation.
