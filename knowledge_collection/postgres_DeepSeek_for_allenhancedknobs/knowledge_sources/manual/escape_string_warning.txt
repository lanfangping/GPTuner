The `escape_string_warning` knob, when enabled (default: on), issues a warning if a backslash (\) is found in an ordinary string literal ('...') and `standard_conforming_strings` is off, helping identify code that should use escape string syntax (E'...') to treat backslashes as escape characters per SQL standards.
