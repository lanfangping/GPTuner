The `log_statement` knob controls SQL statement logging with four levels: `none` (default, off), `ddl` (logs CREATE, ALTER, DROP), `mod` (logs DDL plus INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, COPY FROM), and `all` (logs all statements), with extended query protocol logging occurring during the Execute phase and including parameter values.
