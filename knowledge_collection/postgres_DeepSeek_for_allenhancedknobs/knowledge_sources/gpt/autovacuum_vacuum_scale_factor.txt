Set the `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` value based on the table's update frequency and size, typically starting with a default of `0.2` (20% of the table's rows), but adjust it lower (e.g., `0.05` or 5%) for heavily updated tables or higher (e.g., `0.5` or 50%) for static tables to balance vacuuming overhead and performance.
