To set the value for `bgwriter_lru_maxpages` in PostgreSQL, consider the workload and available memory: for light workloads, start with 100-200 pages (800KB-1.6MB), for moderate workloads use 500-1000 pages (4MB-8MB), and for heavy workloads, adjust up to 2000-5000 pages (16MB-40MB), monitoring performance and I/O to fine-tune.
