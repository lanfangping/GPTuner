Set the `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` value based on the table's update frequency and size, typically starting with a default of `0.1` (10%) for general workloads, but adjust it lower (e.g., `0.01` or 1%) for large, frequently updated tables to ensure timely statistics updates, or higher (e.g., `0.2` or 20%) for smaller, less active tables to reduce overhead.
