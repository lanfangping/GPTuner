Set the `min_parallel_index_scan_size` knob in PostgreSQL to a value (e.g., 512 KB or 1 MB) that balances parallel index scan performance and resource usage, ensuring smaller index scans (below this size) avoid parallelism overhead while larger scans benefit from parallel execution. Adjust based on workload characteristics and system resources.
