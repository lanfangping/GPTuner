Set the `effective_io_concurrency` knob in PostgreSQL based on the number of concurrent I/O operations your storage system can handle: for SSDs, start with a value of 2-4 and increase up to 8-16 for high-performance SSDs, while for HDDs, a value of 1-2 is typically sufficient, as they handle fewer concurrent operations.
