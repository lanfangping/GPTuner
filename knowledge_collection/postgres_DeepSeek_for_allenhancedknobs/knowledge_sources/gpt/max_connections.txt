Set the `max_connections` value in PostgreSQL based on your system's available memory and workload, typically allowing **100-500 connections** for most applications, ensuring each connection has at least **5-10 MB of RAM** (e.g., for 8 GB RAM, a safe range is 100-200 connections). Adjust higher for lightweight workloads or lower for memory-intensive operations.
