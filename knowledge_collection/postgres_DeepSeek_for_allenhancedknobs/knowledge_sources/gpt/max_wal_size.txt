To set the `max_wal_size` knob in PostgreSQL, allocate 1-2 times the size of your largest transaction or checkpoint activity, typically starting with 1GB for small workloads and scaling up to 16GB or more for large databases, ensuring it is at least 10% of the total data size to avoid frequent checkpointing.
