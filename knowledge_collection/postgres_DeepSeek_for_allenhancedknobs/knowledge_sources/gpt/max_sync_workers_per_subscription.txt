Set the value of `max_sync_workers_per_subscription` in PostgreSQL based on the number of available CPU cores and the desired parallelism for logical replication, typically starting with a value equal to the number of CPU cores (e.g., 4 for a 4-core system) and adjusting upward (e.g., 8 or 16) if replication throughput needs to be increased, while ensuring it does not exceed the total number of logical replication workers configured by `max_logical_replication_workers`.
