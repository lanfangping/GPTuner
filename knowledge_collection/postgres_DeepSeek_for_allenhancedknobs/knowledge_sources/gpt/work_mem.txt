Set the `work_mem` knob in PostgreSQL based on the available system memory and workload: for example, start with 64MB for light workloads, 128MB-256MB for moderate workloads, and adjust upwards (e.g., 512MB-1GB) for memory-intensive operations like large sorts or joins, ensuring the total usage (`work_mem` Ã— concurrent operations) does not exceed 25-50% of total system RAM.
