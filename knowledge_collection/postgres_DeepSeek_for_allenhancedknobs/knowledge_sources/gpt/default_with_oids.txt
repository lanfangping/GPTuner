The `default_with_oids` knob in PostgreSQL, which controls whether new tables are created with OIDs by default, should typically be set to `off` (or `false`) as OIDs are deprecated and not recommended for use; this can be done by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file or using the `ALTER SYSTEM SET default_with_oids = off;` command, followed by a restart or reload of the PostgreSQL service.
