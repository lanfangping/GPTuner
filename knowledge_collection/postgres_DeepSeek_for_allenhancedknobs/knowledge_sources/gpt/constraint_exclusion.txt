Set the `constraint_exclusion` knob in PostgreSQL to `partition` (default) to enable exclusion only for partitioned tables, `on` to check constraints for all tables (which can be slower), or `off` to disable constraint exclusion entirely, with `partition` being the recommended setting for most workloads involving partitioned tables.
