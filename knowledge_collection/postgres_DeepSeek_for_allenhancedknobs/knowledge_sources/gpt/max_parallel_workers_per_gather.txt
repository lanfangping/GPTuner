Set the value of `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` based on the number of CPU cores available and the workload type: for OLTP systems, start with 2-4; for OLAP systems, set it to 50-75% of the total CPU cores (e.g., 8-12 for a 16-core machine), ensuring it doesn't exceed `max_parallel_workers` and leaves resources for other processes.
