Set the `bgwriter_lru_multiplier` knob in PostgreSQL to a value between **2.0 and 4.0** (e.g., 2.5 or 3.0) to balance the background writer's aggressiveness in flushing dirty buffers, adjusting higher if the workload is write-heavy or lower if the system has sufficient I/O capacity to avoid excessive flushing.
