To set the `checkpoint_timeout` knob in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on your workload and recovery requirements, typically ranging from **5 minutes (300 seconds)** to **30 minutes (1800 seconds)**, with the default being **15 minutes (900 seconds)**; shorter values reduce recovery time but increase I/O overhead, while longer values reduce I/O but increase recovery time.
