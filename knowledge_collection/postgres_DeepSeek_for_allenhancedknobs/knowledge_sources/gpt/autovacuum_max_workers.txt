Set the value of `autovacuum_max_workers` based on the number of CPU cores available, typically starting with 1-3 workers for systems with 4-8 cores, and increasing up to 5-8 workers for larger systems with 16+ cores, while ensuring it does not exceed the total number of tables requiring vacuuming or cause excessive resource contention.
