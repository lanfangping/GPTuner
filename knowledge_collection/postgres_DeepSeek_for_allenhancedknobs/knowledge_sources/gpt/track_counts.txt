The `track_counts` knob in PostgreSQL, which is enabled by default (`track_counts = on`), controls whether the database collects statistics about table and index access; it should generally remain enabled for optimal query performance, but if disabled (`track_counts = off`), it can reduce overhead in read-heavy workloads where statistics collection is unnecessary.
