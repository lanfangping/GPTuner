Set the `wal_buffers` knob in PostgreSQL to a value of at least 16MB (default is typically 16MB or 1/32 of shared_buffers, whichever is smaller), but consider increasing it to 64MB or higher for high-write workloads to ensure efficient WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) performance without excessive memory usage.
