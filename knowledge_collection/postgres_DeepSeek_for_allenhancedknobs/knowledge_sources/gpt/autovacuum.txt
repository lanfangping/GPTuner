To set the `autovacuum` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it by setting `autovacuum = on` (default) and adjust related parameters like `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` (default 200) and `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` (default 0.2) based on workload; for example, increase the cost limit to 1000 for aggressive vacuuming or reduce the scale factor to 0.1 for more frequent vacuuming on frequently updated tables.
