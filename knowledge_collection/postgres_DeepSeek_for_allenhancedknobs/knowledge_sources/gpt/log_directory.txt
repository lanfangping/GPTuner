Set the `log_directory` knob in PostgreSQL to a directory path where log files will be stored, ensuring it has sufficient disk space (e.g., `/var/log/postgresql/`), and ensure the directory has the correct permissions (e.g., `0755` for the directory and `postgres` user ownership) to allow PostgreSQL to write logs.
