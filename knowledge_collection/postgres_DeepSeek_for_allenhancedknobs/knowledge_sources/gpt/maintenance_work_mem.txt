Set the `maintenance_work_mem` knob in PostgreSQL to a value that is approximately 10% of your total system memory, but typically not exceeding 1GB for most workloads, as it controls the maximum amount of memory used for maintenance operations like `VACUUM`, `CREATE INDEX`, and `ALTER TABLE`. For example, on a system with 16GB RAM, a value of 1GB (1024MB) is often sufficient.
