To set the value for the `lo_compat_privileges` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it by setting it to `on` (or `1`) to allow backward compatibility with older versions where large object privileges were not enforced, or set it to `off` (or `0`) to enforce strict privilege checks for large objects, which is the default behavior in modern PostgreSQL versions.
