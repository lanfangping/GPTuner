The `backslash_quote` knob in PostgreSQL controls how backslashes are interpreted in string literals, and it can be set to one of three values: `on` (always allow backslashes as escape characters), `off` (treat backslashes as literal characters), or `safe_encoding` (allow backslashes only when the client encoding does not allow backslashes in multi-byte characters). For example, set it to `safe_encoding` for compatibility with multi-byte encodings like UTF-8 by running `SET backslash_quote = 'safe_encoding';`.
