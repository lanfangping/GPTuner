To optimize the 'temp_buffers' knob in PostgreSQL effectively, itâ€™s recommended to set its value based on the memory needs of your session's temporary tables, starting with a default of 8MB. This setting can be adjusted within each database session before any temporary tables are first used. It's critical to ensure that increases in this setting, which cost an additional 64 bytes per increment and an extra 8192 bytes when a buffer is utilized, do not exceed the available memory designated for PostgreSQL operations, to avoid performance degradation.
