Suggestion: Set the 'log_min_duration_statement' knob in PostgreSQL to a specific duration such as 250 milliseconds to log the duration of each completed statement that runs for at least this time, helping identify unoptimized queries. Ensure this setting captures an optimal threshold like 250ms, suitable for your applicationâ€™s performance analysis, with the ability to adjust it to zero to log all statements if necessary. Employ additional tools such as pg_stat_statements or pg_stat_monitor for a more comprehensive understanding of query performance. This setting is only adjustable by superusers and defaults to disabling logging if not configured.
