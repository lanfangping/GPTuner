To optimize query performance in PostgreSQL, configure the 'constraint_exclusion' setting. Set it to 'partition' for optimal performance in most scenarios as it focuses on inheritance child tables and UNION ALL subqueries, leveraging table constraints to exclude scanning tables that don't meet CHECK constraints. Alternatively, you can adjust this setting to 'on' to apply this optimization to all tables or 'off' to disable it completely based on your specific requirements.
