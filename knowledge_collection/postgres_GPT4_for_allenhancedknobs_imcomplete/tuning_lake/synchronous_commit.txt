For managing transaction durability and performance in PostgreSQL, adjust the 'synchronous_commit' setting according to your requirements. Options include: 'on' (default, which waits for WAL records to be written to both the local disk and standby replication), 'remote_apply' (waits for the standby server to apply the changes), 'remote_write' (waits for the standby to write the changes), 'local' (only waits for the local disk), and 'off' (does not wait for disk writes, risking up to three times the wal_writer_delay of data loss in the event of a crash). Choose a setting to balance between performance and durability based on your system's needs.
