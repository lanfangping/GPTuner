Suggestion: Adjust the 'geqo_generations' setting in your database to control the number of iterations the GEQO algorithm uses. By default, this is set to zero, which allows the system to automatically determine an appropriate value based on the 'geqo_pool_size'. This adjustment can optimize the performance of the GEQO algorithm in handling query optimization.
