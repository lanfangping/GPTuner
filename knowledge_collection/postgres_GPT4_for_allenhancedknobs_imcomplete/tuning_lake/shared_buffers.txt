To achieve optimal database performance, adjust the 'shared_buffers' setting in your PostgreSQL server to allocate 25% of the system memory for servers with 1GB or more RAM, but it is advisable not to exceed 40% of system memory. For systems with less than 1GB of RAM, configure a smaller percentage for 'shared_buffers'. When adjusting these settings, also consider the direct relationship with OS kernel parameters such as `shmmax` and `shmall`, particularly for environments handling hundreds of GBs. If working with large memory environments, consider establishing huge pages. Also, ensure to perform your own benchmarks to fine-tune this parameter based on specific server usage, acknowledging that each PostgreSQL instance reserves its own memory allocations. Always adjust settings with due consideration to whether servers are dedicated or shared resources.
