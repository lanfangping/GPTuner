Suggestion: Set the 'log_truncate_on_rotation' parameter in PostgreSQL to 'on' to truncate existing log files during time-based rotations rather than appending to them. This facilitates managing logs in predictable cycles. For instance, you can configure the system to overwrite hourly log files every 24 hours or daily log files every 7 days. Make sure to specify the filename patterns and rotation settings in postgresql.conf or via the command line as required.
