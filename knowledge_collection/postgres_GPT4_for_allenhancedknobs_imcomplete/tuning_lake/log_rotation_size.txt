To effectively manage your PostgreSQL logs, adjust the 'log_rotation_size' knob, located in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line, to set the maximum size of individual log files when the logging_collector is enabled. By default, this is set to 10 megabytes, creating new log files when this size limit is reached. However, you can also configure this setting to disable size-based log creation altogether for more tailored log management.
