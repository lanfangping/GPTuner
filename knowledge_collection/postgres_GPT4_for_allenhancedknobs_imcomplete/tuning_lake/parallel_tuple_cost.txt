It's recommended to configure the 'parallel_tuple_cost' knob, which adjusts the planner's estimated cost of transferring a single tuple between parallel worker processes in Postgres. By default, it's set at 0.1. Depending on your system's capabilities, specifically if using SSDs or a fast I/O subsystem, you might consider setting this value lower to promote more frequent parallelism, unless you observe that doing so leads to excessive CPU usage or diminishes the performance of parallel queries.
