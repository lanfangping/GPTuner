To effectively configure the 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' setting in PostgreSQL, prioritize setting the maximum number of workers appropriately. A default value of 2 is typically effective under most configurations. While this value can be increased for analytical or data warehousing (DW) systems to maximize the utilization of available CPU cores, it should be kept to a low value (1 or 2) for high-throughput Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) systems to avoid high resource utilization and potential inefficiency. Ensure that the number of parallel workers does not exceed the global 'max_parallel_workers' and that the number requested aligns with the 'max_worker_processes' pool availability. Additionally, consider the interaction with 'work_mem' settings to optimize system performance further.
