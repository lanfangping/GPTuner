To optimize your PostgreSQL system's performance, configure the 'log_temp_files' setting. This parameter, only changeable by superusers, controls the logging of temporary file names and sizes, with an entry logged for each file when it's deleted. Set 'log_temp_files' to zero to log all temporary files, or to a positive value to only log files larger than the specified data amount in kilobytes. The default setting disables logging. Adjusting 'log_temp_files' can help detect excessive usage of temporary files, which might indicate a need to reevaluate 'work_mem' or 'maintenance_work_mem' settings.
