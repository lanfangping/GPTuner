To manage the PostgreSQL server effectively, ensure the 'autovacuum' feature is enabled, which is the default setting. This feature relies on the activation of 'track_counts'. Both settings can be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file or directly on the server command line. Additionally, you have the flexibility to disable 'autovacuum' for specific tables as needed.
