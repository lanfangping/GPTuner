Suggestion: Adjust the 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' parameter to optimize database maintenance in PostgreSQL. This parameter triggers a VACUUM operation by adding a fraction of the table size to the autovacuum_vacuum_threshold. By default, it is set at 0.2 or 20% of the table size. This setting can be configured globally in the postgresql.conf file or directly on the server command line, and it can also be customized for individual tables as needed.
