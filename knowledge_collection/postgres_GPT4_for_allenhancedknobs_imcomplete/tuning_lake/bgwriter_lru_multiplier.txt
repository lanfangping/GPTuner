To optimize how PostgreSQL handles the writing of dirty buffers, adjust the 'bgwriter_lru_multiplier' setting. This parameter, which should only be configured in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line, controls the number of dirty buffers to be written in each round. This is calculated by multiplying the average recent need by the 'bgwriter_lru_multiplier'. Its default value is set at 2.0.
