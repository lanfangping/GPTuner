To effectively configure the 'work_mem' knob in PostgreSQL, begin by understanding that it sets the base maximum memory for operations like sorting or hashing before spilling over to temporary disk files, with a default setting of 4MB. It's crucial to assess the memory demands of your queries; light operations in OLTP may require only a low MB setting, whereas more complex OLAP queries benefiting from higher settings, potentially in the GB range. Always consider the impact of concurrent queries which increases total memory usage possibly up to max_connections times a few units. Start adjustments around 4MB to 8MB per query, but ensure it's neither too low, which could degrade performance through excessive disk usage, nor too high to avoid excessive system memory consumption leading to node instability. Always monitor performance impact after adjustments to optimize the balance between memory use and system stability.
