To optimize database operations, consider adjusting the 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers' setting, which controls the maximum number of parallel workers available for utility commands like CREATE INDEX or VACUUM. Note that the number of workers actually available at runtime may be lower than the maximum set. Setting this value to zero will disable the use of parallel workers entirely.
