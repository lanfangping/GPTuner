To effectively configure the 'max_parallel_workers' setting in PostgreSQL, set the limit based on the system's computational resources, keeping in mind the default value is typically 8. Ensure that adjustments to this setting are accompanied by corresponding changes to 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers' and 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather'. Also, be cautious not to exceed the 'max_worker_processes' as it would render additional parallel workers ineffective. This optimal setup will leverage the number of CPU cores available while ensuring that the system does not exceed its capacity to manage concurrent processes efficiently.
