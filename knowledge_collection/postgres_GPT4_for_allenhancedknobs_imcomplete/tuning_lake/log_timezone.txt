To effectively set the 'log_timezone' knob in PostgreSQL for managing time zones in server log timestamps, adjust the setting in the postgresql.conf file or directly on the server command line. While the default value is GMT, consider using a specific time zone, such as 'PST8PDT' or 'Europe/London,' or a standard abbreviation like 'UTC' or 'GMT' to ensure consistent timestamps across all sessions. Make sure that the value you assign matches one of the recognized time zones available in the "pg_timezone_names" view.
