Suggestion: Adjust the 'geqo_pool_size' knob to manage the pool size utilized by GEQO, which represents the number of individuals in the genetic population. Useful values often range between 100 to 1000. The default value is set to zero, allowing the system to automatically select a value based on 'geqo_effort' and the number of tables involved in the query.
