Suggestion: Adjust the 'wal_buffers' setting, which allocates shared memory for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data that has not yet been written to disk. By default, it is set to -1, which calculates to about 3% of 'shared_buffers' but never less than 64kB. For manual configuration, any value set below 32kB will be treated as 32kB. This setting is crucial as it is written to disk at every transaction commit, which can enhance write performance on heavily loaded servers.
