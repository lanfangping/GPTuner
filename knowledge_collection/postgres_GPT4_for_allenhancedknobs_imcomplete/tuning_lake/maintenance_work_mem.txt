For optimal performance of maintenance operations such as VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY, it is recommended to configure the 'maintenance_work_mem' setting appropriately. This setting dictates the maximum memory allocated for these tasks, with a default value of 64MB. While it is generally beneficial to set this value higher than 'work_mem' to enhance performance, care must be taken not to increase it excessively. Setting it too high can lead to excessive memory allocation, especially when multiplied by the number of 'autovacuum_max_workers' during autovacuum operations. If your system has substantial RAM resources and handles heavy write operations, consider raising this setting significantly but always within reasonable limits to avoid potential system strain.
