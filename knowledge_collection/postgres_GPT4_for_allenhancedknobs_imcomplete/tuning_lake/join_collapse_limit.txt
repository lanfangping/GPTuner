To optimize your PostgreSQL queries effectively, adjust the 'join_collapse_limit' based on your specific requirements for query complexity and planning efficiency. This setting controls how explicit JOIN constructs are rewritten into lists of FROM items, with a default limit that is the same as from_collapse_limit. For complex queries involving multiple joins, you might want to increase this limit to allow the planner to handle more tables efficiently. However, be cautious as setting it too high can extend planning time significantly. Additionally, a higher 'join_collapse_limit' prevents the reordering of explicit JOINs, enabling advanced users to have more control over the join order, which may be crucial for achieving the optimal execution plan.
