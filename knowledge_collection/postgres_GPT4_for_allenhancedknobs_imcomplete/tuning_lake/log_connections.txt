Suggestion: Enable the 'log_connections' knob to log each attempted and successfully authenticated connection to your server. This setting must be adjusted at session start and only by superusers. Please be aware that seeing duplicate connection messages is normal and not indicative of an issue, as some client programs, such as psql, might attempt to connect twice to assess password requirements. By default, this setting is turned off.
