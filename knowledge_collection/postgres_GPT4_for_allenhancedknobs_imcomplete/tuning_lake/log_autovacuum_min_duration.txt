To optimize the monitoring of PostgreSQL's autovacuum process, adjust the 'log_autovacuum_min_duration' setting. Set it to 250 milliseconds to log any autovacuum actions that exceed this duration. This setting also ensures logging of instances when autovacuum is skipped due to conflicts or dropped relations, providing a comprehensive view of autovacuum activity and its impact on database performance.
