To configure the 'track_activity_query_size' knob in PostgreSQL effectively, set it at server start to an appropriate size that reserves sufficient memory to store the full text of the longest queries you anticipate for each active session. The default setting is 1024 bytes. This configuration ensures complete capture of query texts, maximizing the utility of your monitoring efforts.
