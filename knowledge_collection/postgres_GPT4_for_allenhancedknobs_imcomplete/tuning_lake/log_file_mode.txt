Ensure that the 'log_file_mode' parameter on Unix systems is set properly to manage permissions for log files when the logging_collector is active. Use a chmod numeric mode such as 0640 to enable group reading. Additionally, be mindful of the log file location and the sensitivity of the data within to maintain security.
