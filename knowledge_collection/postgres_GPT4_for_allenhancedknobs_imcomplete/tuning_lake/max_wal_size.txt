When configuring the 'max_wal_size' in PostgreSQL, it's important to manage the size of the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) effectively. You should set this parameter to a size that reflects your system's workload and operational conditions such as disk space and the setting of wal_keep_size. Typically, the 'max_wal_size' should be increased from its soft limit default of 1 GB to manage automatic checkpoints more efficiently, ensuring they are generally triggered by timeout rather than disk space constraints. Keep in mind that while increasing 'max_wal_size' can improve disk I/O and limit excessive checkpointing, it may also increase the duration required for recovery after a database crash. Adjust this setting cautiously to balance performance and recovery considerations.
