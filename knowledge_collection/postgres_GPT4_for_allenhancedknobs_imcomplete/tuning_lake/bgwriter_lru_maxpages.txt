To optimize the performance of busy databases, adjust the 'bgwriter_lru_maxpages' setting in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. This setting controls the maximum number of buffers, up to 100 by default, that can be written by the background writer in each round. Consider increasing this value if you find that the activity of the background writer needs to be enhanced to accommodate high levels of database activity.
