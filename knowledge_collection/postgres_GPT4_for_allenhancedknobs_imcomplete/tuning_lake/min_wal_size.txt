Suggestion: To effectively manage spikes in Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) usage, such as those occurring during large batch jobs, it is recommended to configure the 'min_wal_size' setting in PostgreSQL. This setting helps in recycling old WAL files for future use at a checkpoint when the WAL disk usage remains below the set threshold, which is typically 80 MB by default. Adjusting this parameter appropriately ensures efficient database operations and stability.
