Set the 'effective_cache_size' to reflect the planner's assumptions about the disk cache available to a single query, based on both PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel's disk cache for PostgreSQL data files. This setting influences the likelihood of using index or sequential scans and should be calculated considering both PostgreSQL and the system's caching capabilities but does not reserve or alter actual memory allocations.
