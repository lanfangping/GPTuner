For effective server log management and to track important metrics, activate the 'log_checkpoints' knob. This feature logs checkpoints and restartpoints, detailing statistics like the number of buffers written and the time taken to write them. Configure this setting by modifying the postgresql.conf file or specifying it on the server command line, as it's disabled by default.
