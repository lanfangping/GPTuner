To effectively manage database performance, consider configuring the 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' parameter. This parameter triggers an ANALYZE operation by adding a fraction of the table size, typically 10%, to the 'autovacuum_analyze_threshold.' Adjustments to this knob can be made in the postgresql.conf file or directly on the server command line to best suit your database needs.
