Suggestion: Adjust the 'from_collapse_limit' knob in the planner to merge sub-queries into upper queries effectively, keeping in mind that the default limit is set to eight. Be aware that setting this value to geqo_threshold or more may trigger the GEQO planner, which could result in non-optimal plans. Adjust settings carefully considering the impact on planning time and query plan quality.
