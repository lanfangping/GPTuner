For optimizing the 'geqo_threshold' knob in PostgreSQL, adjust the setting based on the complexity of the queries involving multiple table joins. Utilize the genetic query optimization (GEQO) to efficiently plan queries that include numerous FROM items. This approach helps in avoiding lengthy exhaustive searches for complex queries, while simpler queries may still benefit from the regular, exhaustive-search planner. Adjust the threshold value to trigger GEQO appropriately, opting for a value greater than the default when dealing with complex queries involving many tables.
