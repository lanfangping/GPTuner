To optimize disk I/O operations in PostgreSQL, adjust the 'effective_io_concurrency' setting based on your storage type, database workload, and whether your operating system supports the posix_fadvise function. Setting this value to zero will disable asynchronous I/O requests, which might not be ideal unless necessary. For optimal performance, particularly when using bitmap heap scans, carefully consider these factors to determine the best value for 'effective_io_concurrency'.
