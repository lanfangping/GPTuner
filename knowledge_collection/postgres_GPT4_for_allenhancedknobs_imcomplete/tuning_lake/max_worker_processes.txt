To optimize server performance and maintain consistency between the master and standby servers, set the 'max_worker_processes' knob to a value that matches or exceeds the default of 8. This parameter determines the maximum number of background processes and should only be adjusted at server start. Ensure that the setting on the standby server is the same as or higher than that on the master server to effectively handle queries.
