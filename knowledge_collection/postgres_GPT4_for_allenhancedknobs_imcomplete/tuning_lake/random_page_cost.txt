To optimize the 'random_page_cost' setting, adjust the default value of 4.0 to better reflect the actual costs of random storage reads. This adjustment should take into account your cache rate, the size of your database relative to server memory, and the specific storage technology employed. If your storage has a random access profile similar to SSDs, consider setting this value to around 1.2 to more accurately represent the enhanced capabilities of such devices.
