Ensure that the 'log_rotation_age' parameter is set to control how long a single log file is utilized when the logging collector is active. By default, this is set to 24 hours, but it can be adjusted either in minutes or disabled by setting it to zero. Modifications to this parameter should only be done through the postgresql.conf file or the server command line.
