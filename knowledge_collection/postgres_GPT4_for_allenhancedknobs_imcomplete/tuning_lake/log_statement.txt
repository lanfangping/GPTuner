To optimize log management in PostgreSQL, adjust the 'log_statement' knob which governs the logging of SQL statements. You can set it to various levels: 'none' to disable logging, 'ddl' to record data definition statements like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, 'mod' to log both ddl and data-modifying operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or 'all' to log all statements except those with simple syntax errors or fail before the Execute phase in extended query protocols. By default, this setting is 'none', and only superusers have the privilege to make modifications to this setting.
