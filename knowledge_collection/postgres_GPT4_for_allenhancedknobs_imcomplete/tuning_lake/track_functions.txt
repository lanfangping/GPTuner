To effectively monitor and analyze the performance of different types of functions in your database, utilize the 'track_functions' configuration. This setting allows you to track the call counts and time used by procedural-language functions with the option set to 'pl', or include SQL and C language functions by setting it to 'all'. By default, this feature is disabled ('none'), and it should be noted that simple SQL-language functions that are inlined into the calling query will not be tracked. Only superusers have the authority to change these settings, ensuring controlled access to this tracking capability.
