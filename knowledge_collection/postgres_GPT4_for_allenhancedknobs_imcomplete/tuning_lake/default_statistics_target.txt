To optimally configure the 'default_statistics_target' knob in PostgreSQL, set the default statistics target for table columns without a column-specific target at a value of 100. Consider increasing this value if you are dealing with large tables to potentially improve the quality of the planner's estimates, while being aware that higher values can result in longer analysis times. Ensure that the value is adjusted in accordance with the complexity and size of your database to enhance query performance.
