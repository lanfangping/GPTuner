To optimize database performance, adjust the 'min_parallel_index_scan_size' setting to define the minimal amount of index data needed for considering a parallel scan. This configuration helps determine whether an index can participate in a parallel vacuum without requiring a scan of the entire index but rather focusing on the pages expected to be involved in the scan.
