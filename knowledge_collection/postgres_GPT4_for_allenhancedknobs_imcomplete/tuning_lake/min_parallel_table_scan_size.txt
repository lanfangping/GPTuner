Suggestion: It is advisable to set the 'min_parallel_table_scan_size' knob to at least 8 megabytes (8MB) to determine the minimum table data necessary for initiating a parallel scan. If this parameter is specified without units, it should be understood that the value is in blocks, where each block is customarily 8kB, represented by the BLCKSZ bytes.
