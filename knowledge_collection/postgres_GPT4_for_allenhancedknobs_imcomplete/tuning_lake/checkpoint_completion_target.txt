To optimize the 'checkpoint_completion_target' knob in PostgreSQL, adjust the value on the server command line or in the postgresql.conf file, ideally targeting the default setting of 0.5. This knob sets the goal for checkpoint completion as a percentage of the total time between checkpoints. While it is suggested to increase this to between 0.7 and 0.9 to smooth I/O spikes and minimize potential performance impact during peak database operations, maintain a lower percentage if the value is used for feeding non-streaming replicas.
