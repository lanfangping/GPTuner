Suggestion: Enable the 'log_duration' knob to log the duration of every completed statement without retaining the query text. This setting logs each stage (Parse, Bind, Execute) separately in extended query protocols, providing detailed timing information for statistical analysis in high-load environments. Unlike 'log_min_duration_statement', which logs all steps only if set to a positive value, 'log_duration' focuses solely on the timing without capturing the queries themselves. The default setting for 'log_duration' is off, and it can only be modified by superusers.
