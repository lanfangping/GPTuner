The 'log_autovacuum_min_duration' knob in PostgreSQL logs every autovacuum action that exceeds a specified duration, with 0 logging all actions and -1 (default) turning off logging; durations are in milliseconds, so setting it to 250ms logs actions running for at least that long, and any non-default setting also logs when autovacuum is skipped due to conflicts or dropped relations.
