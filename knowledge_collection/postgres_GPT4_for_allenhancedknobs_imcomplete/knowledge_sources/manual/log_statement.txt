The 'log_statement' knob in PostgreSQL controls which SQL statements are logged, with settings ranging from 'none' (no logging), 'ddl' (logs data definition statements like CREATE, ALTER, DROP), 'mod' (logs both ddl and data-modifying statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), to 'all' (logs all statements, except those with simple syntax errors or fail before the Execute phase in extended query protocols); the default setting is 'none', and only superusers can modify this setting.
