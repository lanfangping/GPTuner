The 'log_truncate_on_rotation' parameter in PostgreSQL, when set to 'on', truncates existing log files rather than appending to them, specifically during time-based rotations, and can facilitate managing logs in predictable cycles, such as overwriting hourly log files every 24 hours or daily log files every 7 days based on filename patterns and rotation settings specified in postgresql.conf or command line.
