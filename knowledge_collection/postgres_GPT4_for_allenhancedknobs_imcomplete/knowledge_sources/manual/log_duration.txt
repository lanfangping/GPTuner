The 'log_duration' knob, when enabled, logs the duration of every completed statement without logging the query text, unlike setting 'log_min_duration_statement' to zero; it logs each step (Parse, Bind, Execute) independently in extended query protocols, and all durations are logged if 'log_min_duration_statement' has a positive value, making it useful for statistical analysis in high-load environments. Default setting is off and only superusers can modify this setting.
