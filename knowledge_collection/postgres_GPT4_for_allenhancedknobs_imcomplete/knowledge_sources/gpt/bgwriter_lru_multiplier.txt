For the 'bgwriter_lru_multiplier' knob in PostgreSQL, which controls the rate of writing dirty buffers during LRU sweeps, it is generally recommended to set its value between 2.0 and 4.0 to increase the background writer's effectiveness, especially in high-write environments, although the default value is 1.0, indicating moderate aggressiveness.
