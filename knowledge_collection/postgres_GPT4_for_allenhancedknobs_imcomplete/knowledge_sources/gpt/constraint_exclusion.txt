For the 'constraint_exclusion' knob in PostgreSQL, set its value to 'partition' to effectively improve performance by only checking partitions that are relevant to the query, but be mindful that setting it to 'on' can lead to inefficiency in databases without partitions, while 'off' disables this feature entirely, and is not generally recommended unless you need to save on planning time and are sure it won't lead to incorrect results on partitioned tables.
