For the 'cpu_tuple_cost' knob in PostgreSQL, which is used to set the optimizer's cost estimation for processing each row, the recommended starting value is 0.01, though this can be adjusted based on the specific performance characteristics of your system; typically, adjustments might range between 0.001 and 0.1 based on system performance and query execution profiles.
