To optimally set the 'bgwriter_lru_maxpages' knob in PostgreSQL, tune the value based on your system's workload and performance, starting at the default of 100, and adjusting upwards in increments (e.g., 200 or 300) during high write-load scenarios to assess the impact on write performance and checkpoint behavior.
