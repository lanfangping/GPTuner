Set the 'join_collapse_limit' in PostgreSQL to a value reflecting the number of tables in a join query you believe the query planner can handle efficiently; for complex queries involving many joins, consider increasing this limit beyond the default value of 8 to potentially improve optimization, while being cautious that setting it too high can lead to excessive planning time.
