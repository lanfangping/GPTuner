For the 'log_rotation_size' knob in PostgreSQL, set the value according to the desired maximum disk space each log file should use, typically configured in kilobytes (kB); common settings range from 1,024kB (1MB) up to 10,240kB (10MB), balancing between manageable log file size and frequency of rotation.
