To set the 'shared_buffers' value in PostgreSQL effectively, it is recommended to allocate around 25% of the total system memory if you have at least 1GB of RAM, but do not exceed the amount of OS-visible RAM by more than several gigabytes, as going beyond this can invalidate the benefit and potentially slow down the system.
