For the 'temp_buffers' knob in PostgreSQL, it is typically recommended to set the value based on your session's temporary table needs, starting with a default of 8MB, and increasing it if you frequently use complex operations involving large amounts of temporary data, ensuring that the value does not exceed the available memory designated for PostgreSQL operations.
