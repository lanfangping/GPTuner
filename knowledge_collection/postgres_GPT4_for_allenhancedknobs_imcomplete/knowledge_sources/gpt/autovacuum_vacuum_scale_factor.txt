Set the 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' value for Postgres between 0.02 and 0.05 to adjust the vacuuming frequency appropriately, balancing between system performance and maintenance overhead, where a lower value leads to more frequent vacuum operations, helping maintain performance in environments with frequent updates or deletions.
