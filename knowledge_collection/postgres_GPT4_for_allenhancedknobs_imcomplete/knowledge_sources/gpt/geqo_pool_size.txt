The 'geqo_pool_size' knob in PostgreSQL, which controls the number of individuals in the Genetic Query Optimization (GEQO) pool, should be set to a value depending on the complexity of the queries; typical settings range from 100 to 1000, with a default of 0 indicating automatic GEQO disabling if the number of tables involved is less than 12.
