Set the 'log_rotation_age' parameter in PostgreSQL to control the maximum age of a log file before it is rotated, typically configured between 1 day (`1d`) and 1 week (`1w`), depending on the volume of log data and the desired frequency of file rotation for operational convenience and disk space management.
