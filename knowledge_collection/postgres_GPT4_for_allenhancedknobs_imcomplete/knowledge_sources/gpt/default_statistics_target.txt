To optimally set the 'default_statistics_target' knob in PostgreSQL, choose a value between 100 to 1000, with the higher end generally providing more accurate query plans at the cost of longer ANALYZE times, while ensuring that the value scales with the complexity and size of the database to enhance query performance.
