For the 'log_filename' knob in PostgreSQL, set its value to a format string like 'postgresql-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S.log' to represent the naming convention, where placeholders like %Y, %m, %d, %H, %M, and %S specify the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second, respectively, based on the time when the log file was created.
