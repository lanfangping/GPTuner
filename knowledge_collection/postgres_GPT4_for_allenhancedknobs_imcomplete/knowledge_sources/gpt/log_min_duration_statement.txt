Set the 'log_min_duration_statement' knob in PostgreSQL to a specific duration in milliseconds (e.g., 0 for logging all statements, 200 to capture statements that take longer than 200 milliseconds) to log statements that exceed this execution time threshold, which helps in identifying and optimizing slow queries.
