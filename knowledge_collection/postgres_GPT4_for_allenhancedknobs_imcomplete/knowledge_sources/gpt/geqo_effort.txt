For the 'geqo_effort' knob in PostgreSQL, set its value between 1 and 10, where a higher value increases the time spent on optimization in the genetic query optimizer, with 1 being the fastest and least effort, and 10 being the slowest and most effort, allowing for potentially more optimized query plans.
