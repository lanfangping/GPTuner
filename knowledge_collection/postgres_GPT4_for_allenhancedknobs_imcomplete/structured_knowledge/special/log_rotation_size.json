{"think_procedure": "To determine whether 'log_rotation_size' is a special knob in PostgreSQL, I will first understand its function and default behavior. This knob controls the maximum disk space used for log files before rotation occurs, measured in kilobytes. I will check if there are any special values that alter its behavior fundamentally, such as disabling log rotation. Upon reviewing PostgreSQL documentation, it is noted that setting 'log_rotation_size' to 0 disables size-based log rotation, which is a fundamental change from its standard behavior of controlling log file size. This indicates that it has a special value (0) that changes its operational mode, thus qualifying it as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
