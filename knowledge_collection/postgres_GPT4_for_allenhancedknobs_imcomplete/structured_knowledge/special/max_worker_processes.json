{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'max_worker_processes' is a special knob in PostgreSQL, we first need to understand its function and range of values. The 'max_worker_processes' knob sets the maximum number of background processes that the system can support. The default value is typically set based on the number of CPU cores. A value of 0 would not make sense as it would disable all background processing, which is critical for the operation of PostgreSQL. We also check if there are any documented 'special' values that change the behavior of PostgreSQL significantly when set. After reviewing the PostgreSQL documentation and common configurations, it appears that all positive integer values are valid, and there are no documented special values such as -1 or 0 that change the operation mode of PostgreSQL drastically or disable a major feature.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
