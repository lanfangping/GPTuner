{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'cpu_tuple_cost' knob in PostgreSQL is a 'special knob', first understand what this knob does. The 'cpu_tuple_cost' is used to set the planner's estimate of the cost of processing each row during a query. This value helps the query optimizer to choose the most efficient query plan. The default value is typically a small positive number (e.g., 0.01). Next, check if there are any documented 'special values' for this knob that alter its behavior in a non-standard way, such as disabling a feature or changing the mode of operation. After reviewing the PostgreSQL documentation and other authoritative sources, if no such special values are identified, classify the knob accordingly.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
