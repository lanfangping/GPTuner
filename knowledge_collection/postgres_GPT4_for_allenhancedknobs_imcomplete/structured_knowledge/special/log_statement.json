{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'log_statement' knob in PostgreSQL is a special knob, we need to understand its function and the values it can take. The 'log_statement' knob controls which SQL statements are logged. The typical values for 'log_statement' are 'none', 'ddl', 'mod', and 'all'. These values dictate the range of statements logged, from none to all. The knob does not use numeric values and does not have any special numeric values like -1 or 0 that alter its behavior fundamentally outside of the predefined options. Therefore, it does not fit the definition of a 'special' numerical knob as described.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
