{"think_procedure": "To classify the 'track_functions' knob of PostgreSQL as a 'special knob', we need to understand what values this knob can take and how these values affect its behavior. According to the PostgreSQL documentation, 'track_functions' can be set to 'none', 'pl', 'all', or other specific function types. Each of these settings enables tracking of function execution at different levels. For example, setting to 'none' disables tracking, 'pl' tracks only procedural language functions, and 'all' tracks all functions. Since 'none' significantly alters the behavior by disabling the tracking entirely, it can be considered a special value. Therefore, 'track_functions' can be classified as a 'special knob' with a special value of 'none'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "none"}
