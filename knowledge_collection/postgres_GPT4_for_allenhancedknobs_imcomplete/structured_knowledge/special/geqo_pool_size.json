{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'geqo_pool_size' is a special knob, first, understand its function and default settings in PostgreSQL. The knob 'geqo_pool_size' is used by the genetic query optimizer (GEQO) to control the number of individuals in the GEQO pool. Normally, it takes positive integer values. Next, check if there are any documented 'special' values that alter its behavior significantly, such as disabling the GEQO or changing its operation mode. After reviewing PostgreSQL documentation, it is found that 'geqo_pool_size' does not have any special values that change its operational behavior outside of the typical range effect; it simply adjusts the pool size for the genetic algorithm. Thus, it behaves as a typical numerical knob without special values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
