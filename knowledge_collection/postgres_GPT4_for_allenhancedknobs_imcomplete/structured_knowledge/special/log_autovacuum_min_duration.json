{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'log_autovacuum_min_duration' knob in PostgreSQL is a 'special knob', we need to understand its function and the impact of its settings. This knob specifies the minimum number of milliseconds that an autovacuum operation has to run before it gets logged. The default value is '-1', which means autovacuum operations are not logged unless they run at least that duration. A value of '0' would mean every autovacuum operation is logged, regardless of duration. Positive values indicate the specific threshold in milliseconds. The presence of '-1' as a disabling value indicates that this knob has a special value which significantly alters its behavior, thus breaking the natural numerical order and functionality.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
