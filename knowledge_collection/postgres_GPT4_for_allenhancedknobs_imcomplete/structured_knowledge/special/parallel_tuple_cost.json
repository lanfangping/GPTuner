{"think_procedure": "To classify the 'parallel_tuple_cost' knob in PostgreSQL as a 'special knob', we need to understand its function and any special values it might have. This knob is used to set the planner's cost estimate for each tuple processed in parallel by a parallel worker. In PostgreSQL, a typical numerical knob has a linear or nearly linear relationship with its effect. A 'special knob' is identified if it includes at least one value that changes this expected behavior significantly, such as disabling a feature or triggering a different mode of operation. We would review the PostgreSQL documentation or source code to check if 'parallel_tuple_cost' has any such special values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
