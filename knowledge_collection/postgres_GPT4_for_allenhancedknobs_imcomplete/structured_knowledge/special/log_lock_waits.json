{"think_procedure": "First, research the purpose and behavior of the 'log_lock_waits' knob in PostgreSQL. This setting is a boolean type, where it can be set to either true or false. If set to true, PostgreSQL logs any lock waits longer than 'deadlock_timeout'. If set to false, it does not log such events. Next, evaluate if this knob has any special values that deviate from a typical numerical progression or fundamentally alter its behavior. Since 'log_lock_waits' is a boolean, not a numerical knob, and lacks any special numerical values that alter its regular operation in a non-linear or non-sequential way, it does not fit the criteria of a 'special knob' as defined.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
