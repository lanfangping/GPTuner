{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'min_parallel_table_scan_size' is a special knob, first understand its function and default behavior. This knob in PostgreSQL controls the minimum amount of table data that must be scanned for a parallel scan to be initiated. By default, this is set to 8MB. Next, investigate if there are any special values that alter its behavior significantly beyond the natural numerical order. For instance, values like 0 or -1 could disable the parallel scan feature entirely or trigger a different behavior. After researching PostgreSQL documentation and resources, it appears that setting 'min_parallel_table_scan_size' to 0 does indeed disable parallel scans for table scans. Thus, it acts as a special value.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
