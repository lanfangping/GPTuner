{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'autovacuum_max_workers' is a special knob, we need to understand its function and any special values it might have. First, we consult the PostgreSQL documentation to understand the role of 'autovacuum_max_workers'. This knob controls the maximum number of autovacuum processes that can run concurrently. Next, we check if there are any special values associated with this knob. Special values typically include numbers like 0 or -1, which might disable the feature or alter its behavior significantly compared to other positive values. After reviewing the PostgreSQL documentation, it is found that setting 'autovacuum_max_workers' to 0 does not disable autovacuum but might prevent any workers from being launched, which effectively stops autovacuum processes. Therefore, we conclude that 'autovacuum_max_workers' is a special knob due to this behavior change when set to 0.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
