{"think_procedure": "First, understand the nature of the 'log_directory' knob in PostgreSQL. This setting specifies the directory where log files are placed. It is a string type parameter, not a numerical type. Therefore, it doesn't have numerical values and isn't associated with special numerical values like -1 or 0 that would alter its behavior in a non-linear way as described for 'special' numerical knobs. Since 'log_directory' is a string type knob and doesn\u2019t involve numerical values affecting functionality, it doesn't fit the criteria of a 'special knob' as defined.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
