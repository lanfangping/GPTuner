{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'geqo_effort' knob in PostgreSQL is a special knob, we need to understand its function and range of values. First, we consult the PostgreSQL documentation or configuration files to find the description and valid values for 'geqo_effort'. According to PostgreSQL documentation, 'geqo_effort' is a parameter that controls the effort spent on genetic query optimization, which is part of the Genetic Query Optimizer (GEQO) used for planning complex queries. The valid range for 'geqo_effort' is typically from 1 to 10, where higher values increase the effort (and potentially the planning time) spent on query optimization. There are no documented special values for 'geqo_effort' that indicate a completely different mode of operation or disable the feature entirely (such as a value that turns off GEQO). Based on this information, 'geqo_effort' behaves like a regular numerical knob without any special values that break the natural order or change the operational mode drastically.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
