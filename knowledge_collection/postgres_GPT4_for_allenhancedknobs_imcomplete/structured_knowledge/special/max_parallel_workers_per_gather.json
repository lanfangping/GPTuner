{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' is a special knob in PostgreSQL, we need to understand its behavior and the impact of its settings. First, we identify what the knob controls, which is the maximum number of workers that can be launched to parallelize a single gather node in query plans that involve parallel execution. Next, we look into the possible settings for this knob. If setting this knob to a specific value (like -1 or 0) results in a behavior that is substantially different from other values (such as disabling the feature), it could be classified as a special knob. We consult the PostgreSQL documentation or experiment by setting different values to see if any such special behavior occurs.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
