{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor' knob in PostgreSQL is a special knob, first understand what the knob does. This knob is a floating-point number representing a fraction of the table size that will be added to 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' when deciding whether to trigger an autovacuum run on a table. The default value is 0.2. Next, check the PostgreSQL documentation or source code to see if there are any special values for this knob that change its behavior significantly, such as disabling a feature or altering its operation in a non-linear way. After reviewing, it is noted that there are no documented special values like -1 or 0 that would disable or significantly alter the behavior of autovacuum differently from its regular scaling function.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
