{"think_procedure": "First, I need to understand the role and functionality of the 'effective_cache_size' knob in PostgreSQL. This setting helps the PostgreSQL query planner make more informed decisions about how to optimize queries, by telling it how much memory is available for caching data. The value is set in terms of blocks (typically 8KB each). To determine if it's a 'special knob', I need to check if there are any specific values that change its behavior beyond the simple scaling of resources, such as disabling a feature or significantly altering the DBMS behavior in an unconventional way. After reviewing the PostgreSQL documentation and common configurations, it appears that 'effective_cache_size' does not have any such special values. It is typically set based on the available memory resources and expected database workload without any specific 'special values' that alter its fundamental behavior in an unconventional manner.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
