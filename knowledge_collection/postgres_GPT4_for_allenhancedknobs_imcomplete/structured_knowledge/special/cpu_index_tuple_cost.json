{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'cpu_index_tuple_cost' is a special knob, we need to understand its function and value range in PostgreSQL. This knob reflects the estimated cost of processing each index entry during an index scan. The default value is typically a small positive number, such as 0.005. Special values, if any, would significantly alter the behavior of this setting, such as disabling index scans or similar drastic changes. After reviewing PostgreSQL documentation and common configurations, there are no indications that values like -1 or 0 have a special, out-of-order function for 'cpu_index_tuple_cost'. It functions linearly within its range, with no special values causing abnormal behavior.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
