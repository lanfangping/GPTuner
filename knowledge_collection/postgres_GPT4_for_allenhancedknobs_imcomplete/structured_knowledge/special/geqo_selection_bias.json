{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'geqo_selection_bias' knob in PostgreSQL is a 'special knob', I need to understand its function and value range. The 'geqo_selection_bias' is used in the genetic query optimizer of PostgreSQL (GEQO) to influence the selection of individuals (query plans) in each generation. It is a floating-point number, where higher values bias the selection towards better-performing individuals. The typical range for this knob is between 1.5 and 2.0, with the default usually set to 2.0. A 'special knob' is identified by having special values that drastically alter its behavior or functionality, such as disabling a feature. For 'geqo_selection_bias', there are no documented special values like -1 or 0 that change its behavior to something fundamentally different, such as disabling GEQO. Instead, it consistently modifies the selection bias within the genetic algorithm. Therefore, it behaves as a standard numerical knob without 'special' outlier values that break its natural operational context.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
