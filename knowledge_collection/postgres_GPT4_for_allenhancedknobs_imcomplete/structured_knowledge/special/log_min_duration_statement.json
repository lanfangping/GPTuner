{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'log_min_duration_statement' knob in PostgreSQL is a 'special knob', we need to understand its function and the impact of its settings. This knob specifies the minimum duration (in milliseconds) for a statement to run before it is logged. The default value is -1, which means that logging is disabled for all statements. A value of 0 indicates that every statement will be logged regardless of its duration. Positive values indicate the threshold duration in milliseconds. Thus, the knob has special values (-1 and 0) that significantly alter its behavior, differentiating it from regular numerical settings where each increment or decrement has a uniform effect.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": [-1, 0]}
