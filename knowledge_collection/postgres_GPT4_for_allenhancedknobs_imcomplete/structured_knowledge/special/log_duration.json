{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'log_duration' in PostgreSQL is a 'special knob', I reviewed PostgreSQL documentation to understand its functionality and possible values. 'log_duration' is a boolean setting that, when enabled (set to 'on'), logs the duration of each completed SQL statement. If it is set to 'off', it does not log the duration. This knob does not have numerical values, nor does it have any special numerical values that alter its behavior in a non-linear or non-sequential way compared to other possible settings. Therefore, it behaves as a typical boolean setting without any special numerical values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
