{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'shared_buffers' is a special knob, I need to consider if it has any values that alter its behavior significantly outside of the normal numerical range. 'shared_buffers' in PostgreSQL is used to define the amount of memory dedicated to caching database blocks. Normally, the value is set based on the amount of system memory available, and increasing it improves cache hit ratios. However, there are no documented 'special' values such as -1 or 0 that change the behavior of PostgreSQL in a fundamentally different way (such as disabling the buffer cache). Therefore, it behaves as a typical numerical knob without any special values.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
