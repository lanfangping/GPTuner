{"think_procedure": "To classify the 'bgwriter_lru_multiplier' knob of PostgreSQL as a 'special knob', we first need to understand its function and range of acceptable values. This knob controls the rate at which the background writer flushes dirty buffers. It multiplies the number of buffers that would normally be written in each round. The default value is 2.0, indicating that it will write twice as many buffers as the baseline. A value greater than 1 increases aggressiveness, while a value less than 1 but greater than 0 decreases it. We then check if there are any special values outside this normal range that change the behavior significantly, such as disabling the background writer entirely. After reviewing the PostgreSQL documentation, it appears that there are no documented special values such as -1 or 0 that would disable the background writer or change its behavior fundamentally. Therefore, the knob does not have special values that break the natural order of its numerical range.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
