{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'temp_buffers' knob in PostgreSQL is a 'special knob', first understand its function and range of values. The 'temp_buffers' parameter specifies the number of temporary buffers used by each database session for operations such as sorting. It is measured in blocks. A review of the PostgreSQL documentation does not indicate any special values such as -1 or 0 that would change the behavior of 'temp_buffers' outside of its standard function (i.e., allocating memory for temporary tables and indexes). The only constraints are that it must be set to a positive integer, and changes only take effect at the start of a new session. Therefore, since there are no special values that alter its fundamental behavior, it is classified as a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
