{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'synchronous_commit' is a special knob in PostgreSQL, first understand its function and range of values. This knob controls the behavior of committing transactions with respect to the write-ahead log (WAL). The possible settings for 'synchronous_commit' are 'on', 'remote_write', 'local', 'remote_apply', and 'off'. Each setting has a distinct impact on the data durability and performance. For example, setting it to 'off' can significantly increase performance but at the risk of losing transactions in the event of a crash, as it does not wait for WAL records to be flushed to disk before reporting success of a transaction commit. Thus, the value 'off' behaves differently from other settings, altering the fundamental behavior of transaction durability.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
