{"think_procedure": "To classify the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' knob of PostgreSQL as a 'special knob', first understand its function and range of values. This knob controls the delay between autovacuum operations to balance the impact on system performance. The default value is typically in milliseconds. Key to classification is identifying if it includes any special values that alter its normal behavior significantly. Looking into PostgreSQL documentation or configuration files reveals that setting 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' to -1 disables the cost-based vacuum delay feature entirely, which is a significant deviation from its standard behavior of controlling delay time.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
