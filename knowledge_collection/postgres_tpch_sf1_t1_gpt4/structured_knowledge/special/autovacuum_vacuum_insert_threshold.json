{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' from the PostgreSQL documentation. 2. Understand the function of this knob: it controls the number of inserted tuples needed to trigger an autovacuum run on a table. 3. Examine if there are any special values mentioned for this knob. 4. Determine if these special values alter the regular behavior of the knob significantly, such as disabling a feature or changing the mode of operation. 5. In PostgreSQL, setting 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' to -1 disables the insert-based autovacuum trigger, which is different from its standard numerical behavior.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
