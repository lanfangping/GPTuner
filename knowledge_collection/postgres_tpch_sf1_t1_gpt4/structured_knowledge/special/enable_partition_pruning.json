{"think_procedure": "To classify the 'enable_partition_pruning' knob of PostgreSQL as a 'special knob', I first need to understand what values this knob can take and what each value means. I will look up the documentation or source code of PostgreSQL to find details about this knob. If this knob can take a value (or values) that significantly alters its behavior in a way that is non-linear or non-sequential compared to other values, and if such value(s) serve as a toggle for enabling/disabling a specific feature rather than adjusting a scale or magnitude, it could be classified as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
