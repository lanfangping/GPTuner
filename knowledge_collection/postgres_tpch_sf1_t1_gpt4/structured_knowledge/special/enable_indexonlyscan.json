{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'enable_indexonlyscan' knob in PostgreSQL is a 'special knob', we need to understand what the knob does and how it behaves with different values. We start by looking up the documentation for 'enable_indexonlyscan'. According to the PostgreSQL documentation, 'enable_indexonlyscan' is a Boolean type parameter that enables or disables the planner's use of index-only scans. A Boolean type parameter typically has two values: true (enable the feature) and false (disable the feature). Since the knob only toggles between enabling and disabling the feature without any other special behavior associated with any numeric values (like -1 or 0 having a different function from just disabling), it does not fit the criteria of a 'special knob' as previously defined.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
