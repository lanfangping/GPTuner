{"think_procedure": "To determine if 'wal_keep_size' is a special knob in PostgreSQL, first understand its function and range. 'wal_keep_size' specifies the amount of disk space in megabytes to be used to keep WAL files on the server to prevent removal due to cleanup policies that might cause issues with replication or recovery. Next, research the PostgreSQL documentation and any relevant community discussions to identify if there are any special values for 'wal_keep_size' that alter its behavior significantly compared to its standard numerical range. If such values exist and change the knob's behavior drastically (e.g., disabling WAL file retention), then classify 'wal_keep_size' as a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
