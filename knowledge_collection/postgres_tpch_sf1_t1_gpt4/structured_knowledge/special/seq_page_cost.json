{"think_procedure": "To determine whether 'seq_page_cost' is a special knob in PostgreSQL, first understand what the knob does. The 'seq_page_cost' setting in PostgreSQL is used to set the cost of a non-sequentially-fetched disk page. This is a floating point number and helps the query planner in deciding the most efficient execution plan by comparing the costs of different strategies. Typically, this value is set based on system performance characteristics. Next, we need to check if there are any special values like -1 or 0 that alter its behavior fundamentally (e.g., disabling a feature or changing modes drastically). After reviewing PostgreSQL documentation and common usage, there are no indications that 'seq_page_cost' has such special values. It behaves consistently as a regular numerical knob where lower values make the planner more likely to choose plans that involve sequential scans.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
