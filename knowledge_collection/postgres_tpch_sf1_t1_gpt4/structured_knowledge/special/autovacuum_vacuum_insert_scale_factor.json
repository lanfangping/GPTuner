{"think_procedure": "To determine if the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' knob in PostgreSQL is a 'special knob', I will follow these steps: 1. Understand the purpose and function of 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor'. This knob is a fraction that determines the threshold for triggering an autovacuum run based on the number of inserted tuples. 2. Check the default and acceptable range of values for this knob. By default, this value is set to 0.2, indicating that autovacuum is triggered when the number of inserted tuples exceeds 20% of the table size. 3. Look for any documentation or notes regarding special values like -1 or 0 and their effects on system behavior. 4. Analyze if setting it to any special value alters its behavior significantly or disables/enables a specific feature that deviates from its normal operation.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
