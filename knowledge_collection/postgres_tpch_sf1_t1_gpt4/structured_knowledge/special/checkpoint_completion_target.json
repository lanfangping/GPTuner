{"think_procedure": "To classify the 'checkpoint_completion_target' knob as a 'special knob', first understand its function and range. This knob in PostgreSQL is used to set the target time for completing checkpoints as a fraction of the total time between checkpoints. Its valid range is between 0.0 and 1.0. The value is intended to spread out disk I/O related to writing checkpoint data, thus reducing I/O spikes. If there are any special values within this range that alter its behavior drastically outside the normal operational scope (e.g., disabling checkpoints or changing the mechanism entirely), those values would classify it as a 'special knob'. Reviewing PostgreSQL documentation and common usage, there is no indication that values like 0 or 1 have special behaviors that deviate fundamentally from the general purpose of the setting. They are just the minimum and maximum of the allowed range, respectively.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
