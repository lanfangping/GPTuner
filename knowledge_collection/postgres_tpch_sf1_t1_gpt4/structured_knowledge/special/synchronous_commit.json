{"think_procedure": "To classify the 'synchronous_commit' knob of PostgreSQL as a 'special knob', I need to examine how it functions and its possible values. The 'synchronous_commit' knob controls the behavior of commit synchronization in PostgreSQL. The possible values for this knob are 'on', 'remote_write', 'local', 'remote_apply', and 'off'. Each value modifies how transaction commits are synchronized with the disk or replicas. Specifically, setting 'synchronous_commit' to 'off' changes the behavior significantly by allowing transactions to be reported as successful before being written to disk, which can lead to data loss in a crash but improves performance. This drastic change in behavior when set to 'off' qualifies it as a 'special value'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
