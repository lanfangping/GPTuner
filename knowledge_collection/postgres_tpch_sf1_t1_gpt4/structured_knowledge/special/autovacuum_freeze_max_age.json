{"think_procedure": "To classify the 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age' knob from PostgreSQL as a 'special knob', we start by understanding its function and default behavior. This knob is used to determine the age at which the autovacuum process will freeze table rows. The default value is 200,000,000 transactions. A special knob is identified by having values that, when set, change its behavior significantly or enable/disable features not directly related to its primary function. Researching PostgreSQL documentation and community resources, we look for any such special values for 'autovacuum_freeze_max_age'.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
