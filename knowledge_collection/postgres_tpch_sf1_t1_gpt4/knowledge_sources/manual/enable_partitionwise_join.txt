The 'enable_partitionwise_join' knob controls whether the query planner utilizes partitionwise join, a method that joins partitioned tables by their corresponding partitions provided all partition keys are included in the join conditions, share the same data type, and have perfectly aligned sets of child partitions; however, due to its high demand on CPU and memory resources during planning, it is disabled by default.
