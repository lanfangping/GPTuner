The 'commit_delay' knob in PostgreSQL adds a time delay before initiating a WAL flush to improve group commit throughput by allowing more transactions to commit via a single WAL flush, but it also increases latency by up to the commit_delay for each WAL flush, and is only performed if at least commit_siblings other transactions are active when a flush is about to be initiated, with the default value being zero (no delay).
