Set the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' value in Postgres to a lower number if I/O is less of a concern, commonly within 2ms to 20ms, but it can be adjusted up to 100ms or set to 0 for no delay, ensuring to balance between minimizing the impact on performance and maintaining the efficiency of autovacuum operations.
