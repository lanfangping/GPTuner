For the 'enable_seqscan' knob in PostgreSQL, it is typically recommended to set the value to 'on' (true) to allow the optimizer to choose sequential scans when appropriate; setting it to 'off' (false) can be useful for query tuning or troubleshooting but should be approached cautiously, potentially impacting performance if not handled properly.
