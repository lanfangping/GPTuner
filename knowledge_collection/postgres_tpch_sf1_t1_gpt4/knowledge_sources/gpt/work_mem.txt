To optimally set the 'work_mem' value in PostgreSQL, evaluate the server's total memory and expected number of concurrent connections, then allocate approximately 25% of the available memory divided by the maximum number of connections, noting that typical values range from 4MB to 64MB per connection depending on the workload and system resources.
