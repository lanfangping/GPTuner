To optimize the 'jit' knob in PostgreSQL, it is typically recommended to enable JIT (set to 'on') for complex queries or workloads that benefit significantly from compilation; however, for simpler queries or OLTP workloads, where execution time is comparatively shorter than compilation time, it may be beneficial to disable JIT (set to 'off') to reduce overhead.
