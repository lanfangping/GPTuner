To effectively manage the 'log_min_duration_statement' knob in PostgreSQL for performance monitoring, set this parameter to capture the duration of each completed statement that runs for a period of your choice, such as 250ms, to help identify unoptimized queries. Itâ€™s adjustable only by superusers and can be set to zero to log all query durations for comprehensive analysis. Additionally, consider utilizing tools like pg_stat_statements or pg_stat_monitor to gain deeper insights into query performance, complementing the usage of 'log_min_duration_statement' for optimal system oversight.
