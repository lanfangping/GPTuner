For the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold' setting in Postgres, it is important to initially set this parameter based on the transaction rate of your system; a sensible starting range is between 1000 and 5000 tuples. This setting, which triggers a VACUUM operation after a certain number of tuples have been inserted, can be configured globally in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. Additionally, it can be tailored for individual tables by amending the table storage parameters. Adjust this threshold in response to the specific workload and the accumulation rate of dead tuples due to insert operations.
