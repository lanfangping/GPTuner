Set the 'effective_cache_size' to configure the planner's assumptions on the disk cache size available to a single query. This setting influences the choice between index or sequential scans and should consider both PostgreSQL's shared buffers and the kernel's disk cache related to PostgreSQL data files. It does not affect the allocated shared memory size or reserve kernel disk cache. Set it by estimating the system RAM, subtract the shared buffers, and twice the product of work_mem and max_connections, all multiplied by 1.1. While setting this, remember that it should be adjusted downward if the server isn't exclusively dedicated to PostgreSQL. Note that this configuration does not control the physical RAM utilized by the queries.
