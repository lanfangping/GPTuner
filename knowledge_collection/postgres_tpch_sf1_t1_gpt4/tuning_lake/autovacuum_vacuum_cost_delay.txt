Suggestion: Adjust the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay' setting, which defaults to 2 milliseconds, to optimize the performance of automatic VACUUM operations in PostgreSQL. You can configure this value globally in the postgresql.conf file or directly on the server command line. Additionally, it's possible to customize this delay for specific individual tables as needed to fine-tune database maintenance.
