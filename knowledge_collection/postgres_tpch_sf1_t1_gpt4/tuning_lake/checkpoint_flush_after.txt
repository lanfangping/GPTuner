Suggestion: Adjust the 'checkpoint_flush_after' parameter in PostgreSQL to manage how often the OS is forced to write data to storage during a checkpoint. This parameter is set in blocks (typically 8kB), with a default value of 256kB on Linux and 0 on other systems. Changing this value can help reduce transaction latency, although it might negatively impact performance under certain conditions.
