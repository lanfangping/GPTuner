To set the 'work_mem' value in PostgreSQL effectively, begin with the default of four megabytes (4MB) and consider adjusting based on specific operational needs and server capabilities. Evaluate your server's total memory and query requirements, particularly focusing on the number and complexity of concurrent operations, since parallel processes may multiply the total memory used. A suggested starting point for most users is 16MB, as it balances performance across various query types while minimizing the risk of destabilizing node throughput. Adjust this setting cautiously, ensuring it does not exceed 25% of available memory divided by the expected maximum number of concurrent connections, which helps prevent excessive memory allocation that could impact overall server performance.
