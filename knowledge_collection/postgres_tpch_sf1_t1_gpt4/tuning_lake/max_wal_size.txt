Suggestion: The 'max_wal_size' in PostgreSQL, which controls the maximum size the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) can grow during automatic checkpoints, should start with a soft limit default of 1 GB. This limit can be exceeded under conditions such as heavy load or high 'wal_keep_size' settings. It's advisable to increase this value to ensure that automatic checkpoints are primarily caused by timeout rather than disk space constraints. Consider adjusting the value based on your workload's intensity and the database's write volume to maintain a balance between checkpoint frequency and crash recovery time.
