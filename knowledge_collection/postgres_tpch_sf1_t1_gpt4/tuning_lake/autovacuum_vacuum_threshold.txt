Suggestion: Adjust the 'autovacuum_vacuum_threshold' setting, which initiates a VACUUM operation on a table once the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples reaches 50. This parameter can be configured globally in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. Additionally, it can be customized for specific tables by modifying table storage parameters to better suit individual needs.
