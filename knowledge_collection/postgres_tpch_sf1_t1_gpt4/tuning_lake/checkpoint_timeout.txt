Given the suggestions provided, I recommend configuring the 'checkpoint_timeout' setting in PostgreSQL, which controls the maximum interval between automatic WAL checkpoints, preset at five minutes. While adjusting this parameter can influence the duration of crash recovery, be aware that larger checkpoint intervals could lead to increased I/O spikes and longer recovery times post-crash. However, smaller checkpoint intervals tend to heighten overall I/O activity. Balancing this setting will help optimize both crash recovery time and I/O performance.
