To optimize parallel query execution in PostgreSQL, adjust the 'max_parallel_workers' setting, which controls the limit for parallel operation workers with a default value of 8. It's important to align this setting not only with the number of CPU cores available but also ensure that it does not exceed 'max_worker_processes'. Additionally, when changing 'max_parallel_workers', synchronize these adjustments with 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers' and 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' to effectively manage system resources and achieve specific performance goals.
