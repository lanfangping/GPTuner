Enable the 'enable_partitionwise_join' knob to allow the query planner to perform partitionwise joins, which efficiently joins partitioned tables by corresponding partitions when all partition keys are included in the join conditions, share the same data type, and have aligned sets of child partitions. Be mindful that this feature is disabled by default due to its high demand on CPU and memory resources during the planning process.
