The 'wal_sender_timeout' knob terminates replication connections that are inactive for longer than a specified time, defaulting to 60 seconds, to detect crashes or network outages, with the value being in milliseconds if units aren't specified, and a value of zero disabling the timeout; different values can be used for different locations in a geographically distributed cluster for better management and failure detection.
