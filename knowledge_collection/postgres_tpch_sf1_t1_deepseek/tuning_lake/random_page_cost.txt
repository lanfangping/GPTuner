To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information in the order of `manual_suggestion`, `web_suggestion`, and `gpt_suggestion`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Manual Suggestion (Highest Priority):**  
   The `random_page_cost` knob in PostgreSQL sets the planner's estimate of the cost of a non-sequentially-fetched disk page. The default value is **4.0**, but it should be adjusted to reflect the true cost of random storage reads. This adjustment should consider factors such as the cache rate, the size of the database relative to server memory, and the type of storage used.

2. **Web Suggestion (Medium Priority):**  
   If your disk technology has a random access profile similar to that of SSDs, set the `random_page_cost` to **1.x** (e.g., **1.2**).

3. **GPT Suggestion (Lowest Priority):**  
   Adjust the `random_page_cost` based on your storage type: use **1.0** for SSDs, **1.5** for high-performance NVMe SSDs, and **4.0** for traditional HDDs (default). Fine-tune within ±0.5 based on workload performance testing.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `random_page_cost` knob in PostgreSQL sets the planner's estimate of the cost of a non-sequentially-fetched disk page, with a default value of **4.0**. This value should be adjusted to reflect the true cost of random storage reads, considering factors such as the cache rate, the size of the database relative to server memory, and the type of storage used. For SSDs, set the value to **1.x** (e.g., **1.2**), and for high-performance NVMe SSDs, consider a value around **1.5**. Fine-tune the value within ±0.5 based on workload performance testing to optimize query planning and execution.
