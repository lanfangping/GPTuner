To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), `web_suggestion` (middle priority), and `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). Since `web_suggestion` is `None`, we will focus on the `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`.

### Step-by-Step Summary:
1. **From `manual_suggestion`**: The `seq_page_cost` knob is a planner's estimate of the cost of a disk page fetch in a series of sequential fetches, with a default value of `1.0`. It can be adjusted for tables and indexes in a particular tablespace.
2. **From `gpt_suggestion`**: If your workload involves frequent sequential scans and your storage system (e.g., SSDs) has faster read performance than traditional HDDs, consider lowering the `seq_page_cost` value from the default `1.0` to a value between `0.5` and `0.8`. This encourages the optimizer to favor sequential scans over index scans when appropriate.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `seq_page_cost` knob in PostgreSQL is a planner's estimate of the cost of a disk page fetch in a series of sequential fetches, with a default value of `1.0`. This parameter can be adjusted for tables and indexes in a particular tablespace. If your workload involves frequent sequential scans and your storage system (e.g., SSDs) has faster read performance than traditional HDDs, consider lowering the `seq_page_cost` value from the default `1.0` to a value between `0.5` and `0.8`. This adjustment encourages the optimizer to favor sequential scans over index scans when appropriate, optimizing performance for your specific workload and storage configuration.
