Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Priority Analysis**:
   - The `manual_suggestion` has the highest priority, followed by `web_suggestion` (which is `None` in this case), and then `gpt_suggestion`.
   - Since the `web_suggestion` is `None`, we only need to consider the `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`.

2. **Contradictions**:
   - There are no direct contradictions between the `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`. The `manual_suggestion` provides a general explanation of the `enable_hashjoin` knob, while the `gpt_suggestion` offers more specific advice on when to enable or disable it.

3. **Combining Information**:
   - The `manual_suggestion` explains that the `enable_hashjoin` knob controls the query planner's use of hash-join plan types, with the default setting being `on`.
   - The `gpt_suggestion` adds that hash joins are efficient for large tables with equality conditions but should be turned off (`enable_hashjoin` set to `off`) when working with small datasets or when hash joins cause performance issues due to high memory usage.

4. **Final Comprehensive Suggestion**:
   - The `enable_hashjoin` knob in PostgreSQL allows you to control the query planner's use of hash-join plan types, with the default setting being `on`. Hash joins are efficient for large tables with equality conditions. However, you should consider setting `enable_hashjoin` to `off` when working with small datasets or when hash joins lead to performance degradation due to high memory usage. This allows the query planner to use nested loop or merge joins instead, which may be more suitable in such scenarios.

This summary encapsulates the key points from both suggestions while prioritizing the `manual_suggestion` as required.
