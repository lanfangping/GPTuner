To create a comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information from the `manual_suggestion` first, followed by the `gpt_suggestion`, and ignore the `web_suggestion` since it is `None`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Manual Suggestion**: This provides foundational information about the `autovacuum_work_mem` setting, explaining that it specifies the maximum memory each autovacuum worker process can use. It defaults to `-1 kB`, meaning it inherits the value of `maintenance_work_mem`. It also clarifies that this setting does not affect `VACUUM` operations in other contexts.

2. **GPT Suggestion**: This provides a practical recommendation for setting `autovacuum_work_mem` to a value between 64MB and 1GB, depending on system memory and workload. It suggests starting with 64MB and adjusting upward if vacuum processes are slow or if memory warnings occur. It also notes that the official documentation specifies the unit in kB, so 64MB is equivalent to 65536kB and 1GB is equivalent to 1048576kB.

3. **Web Suggestion**: This is `None`, so it is ignored.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `autovacuum_work_mem` setting specifies the maximum memory each autovacuum worker process can use. By default, it is set to `-1 kB`, which means it inherits the value of `maintenance_work_mem`. This setting does not affect `VACUUM` operations in other contexts. For optimal performance, consider setting `autovacuum_work_mem` to a value between 64MB (65536kB) and 1GB (1048576kB), depending on your system's available memory and workload. Start with 64MB and increase the value if vacuum processes are slow or if you encounter frequent autovacuum worker memory warnings. Always ensure the value aligns with your system's memory capacity and workload demands.
