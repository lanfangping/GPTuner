To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: **manual_suggestion** (highest priority), **web_suggestion** (middle priority), and **gpt_suggestion** (lowest priority). Since the **web_suggestion** is `None`, we will focus on the **manual_suggestion** and **gpt_suggestion**. If there is any contradiction, the **manual_suggestion** will take precedence.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `temp_file_limit` knob in PostgreSQL controls the maximum disk space a process can use for temporary files, such as sort and hash temporary files. By default, this setting is `-1`, which means there is no limit. If the limit is exceeded, the transaction will be canceled. Only superusers have the privilege to modify this setting. To optimize performance and prevent excessive disk consumption, adjust the `temp_file_limit` based on your system's available disk space and workload requirements. For moderate workloads, a range of **100MB to 1GB** is typically sufficient. However, for systems with high temporary file usage, consider increasing the limit to **50GB to 100GB**, while for disk-constrained environments, a lower limit of **100MB to 1GB** may be more appropriate. Always ensure the setting aligns with your system's capacity and operational needs.
