To summarize the three suggestions into a single comprehensive suggestion, we will prioritize the information as follows: `manual_suggestion` (highest priority), `web_suggestion` (medium priority), and `gpt_suggestion` (lowest priority). We will combine the details while resolving any contradictions based on priority.

**Comprehensive Suggestion:**  
The `jit` (Just-In-Time Compilation) knob in PostgreSQL allows the use of Just-In-Time compilation, which is enabled by default. While it is generally beneficial for complex queries, you may want to disable it for OLTP systems with simple queries to avoid unnecessary overhead. For more granular control, you can adjust the `jit_above_cost`, `jit_inline_above_cost`, and `jit_optimize_above_cost` parameters to define specific cost thresholds for when JIT compilation should be applied, balancing compilation overhead and query performance.  

This summary incorporates the default enabled state from the `manual_suggestion`, the recommendation to disable it for OLTP systems with simple queries from the `web_suggestion`, and the additional details about cost thresholds from the `gpt_suggestion`.
