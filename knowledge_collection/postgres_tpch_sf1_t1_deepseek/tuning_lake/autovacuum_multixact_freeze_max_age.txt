To create a comprehensive suggestion based on the provided JSON, let's analyze the three suggestions step by step:

1. **Priority Analysis**:
   - The `manual_suggestion` has the highest priority, followed by `web_suggestion` (which is `None` in this case), and then `gpt_suggestion`.
   - Since `web_suggestion` is `None`, we only need to consider `manual_suggestion` and `gpt_suggestion`.

2. **Contradictory Information**:
   - The `manual_suggestion` specifies that the `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age` parameter can only be set at server start and mentions the default value of 400 million multixacts.
   - The `gpt_suggestion` suggests setting the value based on workload and multixact usage, typically between 100 million and 1 billion, and emphasizes that it should be lower than `autovacuum_freeze_max_age` to prevent transaction ID wraparound.
   - There is no direct contradiction, but the `manual_suggestion` provides additional context about the parameter being set at server start, which is not mentioned in the `gpt_suggestion`.

3. **Combining Information**:
   - The `manual_suggestion` provides critical information about the parameter being set at server start and its default value.
   - The `gpt_suggestion` adds practical advice on setting the value based on workload and ensuring it is lower than `autovacuum_freeze_max_age`.

### Comprehensive Suggestion:
The `autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age` parameter specifies the maximum age, in multixacts, that a table's `pg_class.relminmxid` field can reach before a VACUUM operation is automatically initiated to prevent multixact ID wraparound within the table. This parameter can only be set at server start, with a default value of 400 million multixacts. When configuring this parameter, consider the expected workload and multixact usage, typically setting it between **100 million (100,000,000)** and **1 billion (1,000,000,000)**, ensuring it is lower than `autovacuum_freeze_max_age` to prevent transaction ID wraparound while balancing vacuum frequency and performance impact.
