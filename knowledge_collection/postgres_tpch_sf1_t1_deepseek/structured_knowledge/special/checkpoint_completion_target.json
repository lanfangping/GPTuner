{"think_procedure": "1. Identify the knob in question: checkpoint_completion_target. 2. Understand its normal operation: it specifies the target of checkpoint completion, aiming to spread out the checkpoint I/O load over time. 3. Determine if it has any special values: typically, this knob does not have special values like -1 or 0 that would disable or significantly alter its function. 4. Conclude based on the analysis: since checkpoint_completion_target operates within a defined range (0.0 to 1.0) without any special values that break its natural order or function, it is not classified as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
