To set the value for the `enable_hashagg` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (`enable_hashagg = on`) for scenarios involving large datasets or complex aggregations where hash aggregation is more efficient, or disable it (`enable_hashagg = off`) for smaller datasets or when nested loop or sort-based aggregation is preferred, typically for datasets under 10,000 rows or when memory usage needs to be minimized.
