To set the `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` in PostgreSQL, adjust it based on the table's update frequency and size, typically starting with a default of `0.1` (10%) for general workloads, but lowering it to `0.01` (1%) or less for large, frequently updated tables to ensure more frequent statistics updates and better query planning.
