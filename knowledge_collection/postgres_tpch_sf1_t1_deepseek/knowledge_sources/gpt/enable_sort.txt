To set the `enable_sort` knob in PostgreSQL, enable it (`on`) for queries that benefit from sorting operations, typically when dealing with small to medium datasets (e.g., less than 10,000 rows), and disable it (`off`) for large datasets or when sorting is unnecessary, as it can reduce query overhead and improve performance.
