The `jit` (Just-In-Time Compilation) knob in PostgreSQL can be set to `on` (enabled by default for queries with high cost thresholds, typically above 100,000), `off` (disabled entirely), or adjusted via `jit_above_cost`, `jit_inline_above_cost`, and `jit_optimize_above_cost` to control when JIT is applied, with default thresholds of 100,000, 500,000, and 5,000, respectively, to balance compilation overhead and query performance.
