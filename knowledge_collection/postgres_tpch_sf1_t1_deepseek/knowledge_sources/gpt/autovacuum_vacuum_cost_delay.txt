Set the `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` value based on workload and system performance: start with the default `20ms`, reduce it to `2-10ms` for faster vacuuming on high-performance systems, or increase it to `50-100ms` for systems with heavy concurrent workloads to minimize performance impact. Adjust incrementally while monitoring system behavior.
