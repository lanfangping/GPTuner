Set the `default_statistics_target` knob in PostgreSQL to a value between **100 and 1000** (default is 100), where higher values improve query planning accuracy for complex queries at the cost of increased `ANALYZE` time and storage for statistics; for OLTP workloads, **100-200** is typically sufficient, while **500-1000** is recommended for data warehousing or analytical workloads with complex queries.
