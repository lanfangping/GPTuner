Set the `shared_buffers` knob in PostgreSQL to approximately **25% of your system's total RAM** for dedicated database servers, with a typical starting point of **4GB for systems with 16GB RAM**, but ensure it does not exceed **40% of total RAM** to avoid memory contention with the operating system and other processes.
