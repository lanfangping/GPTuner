Set the value of `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` based on the number of CPU cores available and workload characteristics, typically starting with 2-4 for moderate workloads on systems with 8-16 cores, and increasing up to half the total CPU cores (e.g., 8 on a 16-core system) for highly parallelizable queries, while ensuring it doesn't exceed `max_parallel_workers` and balances with other parallel settings.
