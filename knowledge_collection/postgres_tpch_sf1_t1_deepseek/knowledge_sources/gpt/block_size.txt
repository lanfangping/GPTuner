The `block_size` knob in PostgreSQL, which determines the size of data blocks (typically 8KB by default), should generally not be changed unless you have specific hardware or workload requirements, as it requires reinitializing the database cluster; if altered, common values are 4KB, 8KB, 16KB, or 32KB, with 8KB being optimal for most workloads due to its balance between I/O efficiency and memory usage.
