The 'full_page_writes' knob in PostgreSQL, when turned on, writes the entire content of each disk page to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) during the first modification after a checkpoint to ensure data integrity in case of a system crash, but this increases the amount of data written to WAL; turning it off can speed up normal operation but may risk data corruption.
