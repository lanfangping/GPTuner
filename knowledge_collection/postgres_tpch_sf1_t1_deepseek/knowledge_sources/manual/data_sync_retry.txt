The 'data_sync_retry' knob in PostgreSQL, when set to 'off' (default setting), triggers a PANIC-level error and crashes the server if there's a failure in flushing modified data files to the system, but when set to 'on', it allows the system to report an error and continue running for a retry in a later checkpoint, which should only be done after investigating the operating system's treatment of buffered data in case of write-back failure.
