The 'wal_level' knob in Postgres can be set to one of four values: 'minimal', 'replica', 'logical', or 'archive', with 'minimal' producing the least WAL data (only enough for crash recovery or non-concurrent backup) and 'logical' producing the most (needed for logical decoding), so choose the level based on your specific needs for data durability, replication, and backup.
