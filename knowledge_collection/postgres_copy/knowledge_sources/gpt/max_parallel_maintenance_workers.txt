The 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers' knob in Postgres controls the maximum number of workers that can be used by a single VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, or CLUSTER command; the default value is 2, but it can be increased depending on the number of CPUs and the I/O load of your system, but should not exceed the value of 'max_worker_processes'.
