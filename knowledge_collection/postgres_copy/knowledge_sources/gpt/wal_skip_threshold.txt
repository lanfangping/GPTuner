The 'wal_skip_threshold' knob in Postgres is set to determine the size of data changes that can be skipped during the write-ahead logging (WAL) process, and its value can be set anywhere from 0 to 2^30-1 bytes, with a higher value meaning more data changes can be skipped, potentially improving performance but at the risk of data loss in the event of a crash.
