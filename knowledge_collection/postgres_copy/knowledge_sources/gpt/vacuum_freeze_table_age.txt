The 'vacuum_freeze_table_age' knob in Postgres can be set to a specific value that determines the age at which the system will begin to autovacuum a table to prevent transaction ID wraparound, with the default value being 150 million transactions, but it can be set anywhere between 0 and 2 billion transactions.
