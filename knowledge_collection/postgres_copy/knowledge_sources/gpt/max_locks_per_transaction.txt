The 'max_locks_per_transaction' in Postgres should be set based on your system's maximum capacity, but a good starting point is the default value of 64. If you have complex transactions or a high level of concurrency, you may need to increase this value, but be aware that each lock consumes about 280 bytes of shared memory, so ensure your system has enough memory to handle the increased number of locks.
