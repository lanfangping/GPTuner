The 'cpu_tuple_cost' knob in Postgres is used to set the estimated cost of processing each row during a query, with a default value of 0.01; increasing this value makes the system more likely to choose plans that scan fewer rows, while decreasing it makes the system more likely to choose plans that involve more CPU operations.
