The 'parallel_setup_cost' knob in Postgres is used to set the planner's estimate of the cost of launching parallel worker threads, with a default value of 1000; it can be adjusted based on the system's performance, but it should be noted that setting it too low may result in excessive use of parallel queries for simple tasks.
