The 'effective_cache_size' in Postgres should be set to an estimate of how much memory is available for disk caching by the operating system and within the database itself, after taking into account what's used by the OS, other applications, and active database connections; typically this is set to about 50%-70% of the total RAM if Postgres is the only major service on the machine.
