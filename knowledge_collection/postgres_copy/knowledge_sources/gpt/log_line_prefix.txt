The 'log_line_prefix' knob in Postgres can be set by providing a string value that can include special escape characters, such as '%m' for timestamp, '%u' for username, '%d' for database name, etc., to customize the format of the log line prefix, for example, 'log_line_prefix = '%m [%p] %q%u@%d ' would result in log lines like '2005-01-10 10:20:30 [535] dbuser@dbname statement: SELECT * FROM users;'.
