The 'gin_pending_list_limit' knob in Postgres controls the maximum size of the pending list for GIN index creation, and it can be set to a value between 64 kilobytes and 1 gigabyte, with the default being 4 megabytes; increasing this value can speed up GIN index creation at the cost of increased memory usage.
