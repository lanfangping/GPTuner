Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to set the 'max_worker_processes' in postgres to a value that is equal to or higher than the number of CPUs in your system. This parameter sets the maximum number of background processes the system can support and should be the same or higher on a standby server as on the master server to allow queries. Please note that this value can only be set at server start with a default value of 8.
