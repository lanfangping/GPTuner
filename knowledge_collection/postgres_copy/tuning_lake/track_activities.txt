The 'track_activities' knob in Postgres is a feature that allows the gathering of data on the ongoing command of each session, including its starting time. This feature is automatically enabled, providing the ability to track the activities of all roles, which can be beneficial for monitoring and debugging purposes. However, only superusers and the session's owner have the privilege to view this information, and only superusers have the authority to modify this setting.
