I suggest adjusting the 'wal_skip_threshold' knob, which is applicable when 'wal_level' is set to minimal. This knob determines the method of persisting new data after a transaction. If the data is smaller than the set value, it will be written to the WAL log. If it's larger, an fsync of the affected files will be used. The value is measured in kilobytes unless specified otherwise, and the default value is 2MB.
