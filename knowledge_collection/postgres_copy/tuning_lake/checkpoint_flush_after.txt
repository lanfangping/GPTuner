Based on the manual suggestion, it is recommended to adjust the 'checkpoint_flush_after' knob in PostgreSQL. This knob forces the OS to issue writes to the storage when more than a specified amount of data has been written during a checkpoint. While this can reduce transaction latency, it may degrade performance in some cases. The value is measured in blocks, typically 8kB. The default is 256kB on Linux and 0 elsewhere. Please consider these factors when adjusting the knob to optimize your PostgreSQL performance.
