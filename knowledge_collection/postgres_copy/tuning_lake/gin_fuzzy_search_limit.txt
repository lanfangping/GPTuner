Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'gin_fuzzy_search_limit' knob in Postgres as it sets a soft upper limit on the size of the set returned by GIN index scans. This knob controls the maximum number of rows that the system will scan for fuzzy search queries. Please note that while increasing this value can improve search accuracy, it may also reduce performance.
