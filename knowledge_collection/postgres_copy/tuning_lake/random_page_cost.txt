Suggestion: The 'random_page_cost' knob in Postgres is used to set the planner's estimate of the cost of a non-sequentially fetched disk page. Its default value is 4.0, but it can be adjusted to reflect the true cost of random storage reads. This adjustment should be based on factors such as the cache rate, the size of the database relative to server memory, and the type of storage used. For instance, if your disk technology has a random access profile similar to that of SSDs, you might consider setting it to a value around 1.2.
