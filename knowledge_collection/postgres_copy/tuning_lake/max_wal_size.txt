Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'max_wal_size' in PostgreSQL, which controls the maximum size the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) can grow during automatic checkpoints. This value has a soft limit, which can be exceeded under certain conditions like heavy load or high wal_keep_size setting. Unless there are disk space constraints, consider raising this value to ensure that automatic checkpoints are typically caused by timeout and not by disk space. However, be aware that increasing this value may extend the time required for crash recovery. It should be set based on your workload and how much disk space you are willing to use for recovery purposes, especially if a heavy write load is expected.
