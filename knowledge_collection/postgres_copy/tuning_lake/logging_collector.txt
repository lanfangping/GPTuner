For optimal performance and reliability, it's suggested to activate the 'logging_collector' parameter in Postgres. This parameter initiates a background process that captures and redirects log messages into log files, providing a reliable method for high volume logging and preventing message loss even under high load. It's particularly recommended for production databases to facilitate troubleshooting. However, please note that this setting can only be adjusted at server start.
