I suggest enabling the 'hot_standby_feedback' setting in PostgreSQL if you wish to prevent read-only query cancellations running in the replicas. This setting controls whether a hot standby sends feedback about executing queries to the primary or upstream standby. However, be aware that while this can prevent query cancellations, it may lead to increased database bloat and Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) disk space consumption. Feedback is sent no more than once per wal_receiver_status_interval.
