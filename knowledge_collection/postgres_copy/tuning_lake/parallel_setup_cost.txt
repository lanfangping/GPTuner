Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to use the 'parallel_setup_cost' knob in Postgres to determine the estimated cost of initiating parallel worker processes. The default setting for this is 1000. This knob is used to set the planner's estimate of the cost of launching parallel worker threads. However, caution is advised when adjusting this setting as setting it too low may result in excessive use of parallel queries for simple tasks.
