Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'default_statistics_target' knob in Postgres according to your system's requirements. This knob sets the default statistics target for table columns without a column-specific target. If you have large tables, consider raising this value. However, be aware that while increasing this value may improve the quality of the planner's estimates and your query plans, it may also increase the time needed for analysis and result in longer ANALYZE runtimes. Medium-sized systems typically do well with values around 200, but larger systems may need to increase it further. Make sure to understand the effects of raising this value before making any changes.
