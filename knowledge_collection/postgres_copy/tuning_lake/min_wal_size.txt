Suggestion: The 'min_wal_size' knob in PostgreSQL is used to recycle old WAL files for future use at a checkpoint if the WAL disk usage stays below this setting. It is typically set at a value that can handle spikes in WAL usage such as during large batch jobs. However, the default value may be low for some systems. Unless you have significant disk space restrictions, consider raising it to a value that suits your system's write loads and needs. This setting determines the minimum size to shrink the WAL to after old segments are removed.
