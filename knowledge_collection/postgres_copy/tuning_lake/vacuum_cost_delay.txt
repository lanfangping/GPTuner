The 'vacuum_cost_delay' knob in Postgres refers to the pause duration when the cost limit is exceeded during a process. It is measured in milliseconds by default, with a default value that disables cost-based vacuum delay. Positive values activate cost-based vacuuming, but large delays are not recommended. This setting determines the delay between vacuuming operations to reduce system load.
