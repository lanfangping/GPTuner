Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'log_destination' knob in PostgreSQL to set your preferred log destinations. This can include 'stderr', 'csvlog', 'syslog', or 'eventlog' (for Windows users), and you can use multiple methods separated by commas. By default, the setting is 'stderr' only. This parameter can be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. If 'csvlog' is included, logs will be output in CSV format, which requires the logging_collector to be enabled.
