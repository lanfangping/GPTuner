I suggest adjusting the 'wal_writer_flush_after' parameter in PostgreSQL to manage the frequency of the WAL writer flushing WAL in terms of volume. The default setting is 1MB, but you can change this according to your needs. If you set it to 0, the WAL data will always be immediately flushed. Please note that this parameter can only be modified in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.
