Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to utilize the 'enable_indexscan' knob in Postgres. This feature is enabled by default and allows the query planner to use index-scan plan types. It can be set to either 'on' or 'off'. When set to 'on', the system can use an index scan if it deems it more efficient. Conversely, setting it to 'off' disables this option, forcing the system to use a sequential scan instead.
