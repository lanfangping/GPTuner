As a suggestion, superusers should carefully adjust the 'max_stack_depth' knob, which defines the maximum safe depth of the server's execution stack. Ideally, it should be set to the kernel's stack size limit minus a safety margin of about a megabyte. By default, it is set to two megabytes (2MB). However, caution is advised as setting it higher than the kernel limit can lead to the backend process crashing.
