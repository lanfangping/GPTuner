The 'from_collapse_limit' knob in the planner merges sub-queries into upper queries if the resulting FROM list has no more than the set limit, which is eight by default. This can impact planning time and the quality of the query plan. If this value is set to geqo_threshold or higher, it may trigger the GEQO planner, which could potentially lead to non-optimal plans. However, for complex queries with many JOINs, increasing this limit could be beneficial, but it may also increase planning time.
