As a suggestion, the 'track_io_timing' knob in Postgres, which is a Boolean type configuration, is designed to enable timing of database I/O calls. However, it is turned off by default to prevent potential overhead from repeated time queries to the operating system. The timing information it provides can be viewed in pg_stat_database, sql-explain's BUFFERS option, and pgstatstatements. Please note that only superusers have the authority to alter this setting.
