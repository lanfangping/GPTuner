I suggest setting the 'wal_level' knob according to your specific needs as it determines the amount of information written to the WAL. The default value is 'replica', which supports WAL archiving and replication. The 'minimal' value only logs information for crash recovery, while 'logical' adds information for logical decoding. Each level includes the information logged at lower levels. Please note that this setting can only be adjusted at server start.
