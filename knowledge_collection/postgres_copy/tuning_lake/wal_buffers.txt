As a suggestion, consider adjusting the 'wal_buffers' knob, which pertains to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data that hasn't been written to disk yet. Its default setting is -1, which is approximately 3% of shared_buffers, but it should not be less than 64kB or more than 16MB. You can manually set this value, but any value less than 32kB will be treated as 32kB. This data is written to disk at every transaction commit, which could potentially enhance write performance on busy servers.
