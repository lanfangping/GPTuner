Suggestion: The 'max_parallel_workers_per_gather' parameter in postgres sets the maximum number of workers, with a default value of 2, that can be initiated by a single Gather or Gather Merge node. This value is taken from the pool established by max_worker_processes and is limited by max_parallel_workers. However, be aware that the requested number of workers may not be available at run time, which could lead to inefficiency. Also, parallel queries may significantly increase resource utilization. It's important to consider the number of cores in your system when setting this value, but it should never exceed the number of cores. A good starting point could be half the number of cores. Be cautious about setting a high value for high throughput OLTP systems, often it is better to keep it at 1 or 2. For analytical/DW systems, you can raise it, but always to a fraction of cores. This parameter is also affected by work_mem, so it's recommended to review that value accordingly.
