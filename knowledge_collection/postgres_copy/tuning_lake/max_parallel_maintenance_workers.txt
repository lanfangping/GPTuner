Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'max_parallel_maintenance_workers' knob in Postgres. This knob sets the maximum number of parallel workers that can be used by a single utility command such as CREATE INDEX or VACUUM. The default value is 2, but it can be increased depending on the number of CPUs and the I/O load of your system. However, it should not exceed the value of 'max_worker_processes'. Be aware that the actual number available at run time could potentially be less. Setting this value to 0 disables the use of parallel workers.
