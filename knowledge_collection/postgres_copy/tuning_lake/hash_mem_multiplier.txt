Suggestion: The 'hash_mem_multiplier' in Postgres is a configuration parameter used to calculate the maximum memory that hash-based operations can use. It does this by multiplying the 'work_mem' value by 'hash_mem_multiplier'. The default value is 1.0, but it can be increased to between 1.5 to 2.0 for mixed workloads, or even 2.0 to 8.0 in environments where 'work_mem' is already over 40MB, particularly if there are regular memory pressure issues. However, be cautious not to set it too high to avoid excessive memory consumption.
