Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'max_standby_streaming_delay' setting in Hot Standby in Postgres. This parameter determines the maximum duration the standby server will wait before cancelling standby queries that conflict with incoming WAL entries, particularly when WAL data is received via streaming replication. The default value is 30 seconds, but it can be set to a specific number of milliseconds, such as 30000, or even to wait indefinitely. If your primary use of the replica is for failover and read-only queries, you may consider setting it to ‘0’. However, if 'hot_standby_feedback' is set, you may want to set it to the maximum lag tolerable, which also acts as a ceiling for the maximum query duration before a conflicting query gets cancelled. Please note that this parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.
