Based on the manual suggestion, it is recommended to adjust the 'autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor' parameter in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. This parameter determines a fraction of the table size, defaulting to 0.2 or 20%, to be added to autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold to decide when to trigger a VACUUM. Remember, you have the ability to override this setting for individual tables if necessary.
