As a suggestion, consider the 'wal_compression' feature in PostgreSQL. When enabled, it compresses full page images written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL), which can reduce the volume of the WAL and potentially prevent data corruption. However, be aware that this may lead to increased CPU usage due to the compression and decompression process. This feature is turned off by default and can only be modified by superusers.
