Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to manage the 'wal_sender_timeout' in Postgres for better management and failure detection in a geographically distributed cluster. This knob, which defaults to 60 seconds (60000 milliseconds), is used to terminate replication connections that are inactive for longer than the specified time, thereby detecting crashes or network outages. The value is in milliseconds if units aren't specified, and setting it to zero disables the timeout. You can adjust this value based on the specific needs of your database replication process and use different values for different locations within your cluster.
