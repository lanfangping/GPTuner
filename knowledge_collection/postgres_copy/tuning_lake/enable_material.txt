The 'enable_material' knob in Postgres is a configuration that allows or prevents the query planner's use of materialization. By default, it is set to 'on', enabling the system to use materialization while executing a query. However, if you wish to disable this, you can set it to 'off'. Please note that turning it 'off' does not completely suppress materialization.
