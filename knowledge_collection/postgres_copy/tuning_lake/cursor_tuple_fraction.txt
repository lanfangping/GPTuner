I suggest adjusting the 'cursor_tuple_fraction' knob to influence the planner's estimate of the fraction of a cursor's rows that will be retrieved. This knob, which is set at a default of 0.1, affects the speed at which the first few rows are retrieved and the total estimated time it takes to fetch all rows. By increasing the setting, cursors will be treated more like regular queries.
