To enhance group commit throughput in PostgreSQL, consider adjusting the 'commit_delay' knob. This knob introduces a time delay before initiating a Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) flush, allowing more transactions to be committed via a single WAL flush. However, be aware that this also increases latency by up to the commit_delay for each WAL flush. This delay is only implemented if at least commit_siblings other transactions are active when a flush is about to be initiated. The default value is zero, meaning there is no delay.
