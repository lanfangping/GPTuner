Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to understand that the 'vacuum_cost_page_miss' knob in Postgres refers to the estimated cost of vacuuming a buffer that needs to be read from the disk. This process includes locking the buffer pool, looking up the shared hash table, reading the desired block from the disk, and scanning its content, with a default value of 10. Adjusting this value can influence the speed of vacuuming operations and subsequently the system load.
