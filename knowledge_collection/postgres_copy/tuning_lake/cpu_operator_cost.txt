Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended that you adjust the 'cpu_operator_cost' knob, which sets the estimated cost of processing each operator or function during a query. The default setting for this is 0.0025. However, you should modify this value according to your specific workload and hardware. Remember, a lower value will make CPU operations seem less expensive to the query planner.
