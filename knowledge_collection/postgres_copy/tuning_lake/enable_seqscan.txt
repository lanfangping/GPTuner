The 'enable_seqscan' knob in Postgres allows you to either enable or disable the query planner's use of sequential scan plan types. However, it cannot completely suppress sequential scans. The knob can be set to either 'on' or 'off', with 'on' allowing the system to perform sequential scans. It's generally recommended to leave it 'on' (default) unless you have a specific reason, as turning it off can lead to poor performance.
