I suggest adjusting the 'autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor' parameter in the postgresql.conf file or server command line. This knob determines if an ANALYZE operation should be triggered by adding a fraction of the table size to the autovacuum_analyze_threshold. The default is set at 0.1, meaning an ANALYZE operation will be initiated after 10% of the table's rows have been updated or inserted.
