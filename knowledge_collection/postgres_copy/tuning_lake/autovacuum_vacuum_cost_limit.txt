As a suggestion, you should consider adjusting the 'autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit' setting in PostgreSQL. This parameter sets the cost limit for automatic VACUUM operations and its value is proportionally distributed among multiple running autovacuum workers to ensure their combined limits do not exceed this variable's value. Please note that this setting can only be modified in the postgresql.conf file or server command line. However, it can be overridden for specific tables by altering table storage parameters.
