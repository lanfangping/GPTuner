Suggestion: The 'log_min_duration_statement' knob in Postgres, adjustable only by superusers, logs the duration of each completed statement that runs for at least a specified time, such as 250ms, aiding in the identification of unoptimized queries. However, it's not advisable to set it to log all queries unless your service consistently experiences low traffic. Logging all queries could potentially bring down a high-traffic server. Instead, find a reasonable value suitable for your application (e.g. ‘1s’) and utilize other tools like pg_stat_statements or pg_stat_monitor to understand query performance.
