As a suggestion, you should adjust the 'wal_writer_delay' knob in PostgreSQL to specify the frequency at which the WAL writer flushes WAL. By default, it is set to 200 milliseconds. If set without units, it's considered in milliseconds. However, it only writes to the operating system and not flushed to disk if the last flush was less than this delay and less than 'wal_writer_flush_after' worth of WAL has been produced.
