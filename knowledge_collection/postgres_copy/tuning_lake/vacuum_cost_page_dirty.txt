Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'vacuum_cost_page_dirty' knob in Postgres. This knob represents the estimated cost applied when a vacuum modifies a previously clean block, accounting for the additional I/O needed to reflush the dirty block to the disk. The default value is usually set to 20, but this can be adjusted depending on the workload and performance requirements.
