Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to set the 'max_locks_per_transaction' in Postgres according to your system's maximum capacity. This knob controls the average number of object locks per transaction, calculated as max_locks_per_transaction * (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions). The default value is 64 and it can only be set at server start. It does not limit the number of rows that can be locked, but may need to be increased for queries involving many tables. If you have complex transactions or a high level of concurrency, you may need to increase this value. However, be aware that each lock consumes about 280 bytes of shared memory, so ensure your system has enough memory to handle the increased number of locks. On a standby server, it must be set to the same or higher value than on the master server.
