I suggest setting the 'cluster_name' knob to assign an identifying name for your PostgreSQL database cluster. This name will appear in all server processes and act as the default application name for a standby connection. The name can have a maximum length of 64 characters in a standard build, and only printable ASCII characters are allowed. This is particularly useful if you have more than one PostgreSQL instance running per server, as it helps distinguish them when listing processes and logs. It's generally convenient to set it regardless.
