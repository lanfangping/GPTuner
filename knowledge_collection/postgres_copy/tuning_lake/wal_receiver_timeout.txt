Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'wal_receiver_timeout' setting in Postgres. This setting, which defaults to 60 seconds, determines the amount of time the system will wait for data from the master before terminating inactive replication connections. This helps the receiving standby server detect a primary node crash or network outage. Please note that this setting can only be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.
