Suggestion: The 'autovacuum_naptime' knob in Postgres is used to set the delay between autovacuum runs on a database. By default, it is set to one minute or 60 seconds. However, this can be adjusted based on the frequency of data updates and the performance of the system. The configuration can be done in the postgresql.conf file or directly on the server command line.
