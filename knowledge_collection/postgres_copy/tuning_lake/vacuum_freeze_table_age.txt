Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'vacuum_freeze_table_age' knob in Postgres. This setting triggers an aggressive scan by VACUUM if a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field reaches the age specified by this setting. The default value is set at 150 million transactions. However, it's important to note that VACUUM will limit the effective value to 95% of autovacuum_freeze_max_age. This knob essentially determines the age at which the system will begin to autovacuum a table to prevent transaction ID wraparound.
