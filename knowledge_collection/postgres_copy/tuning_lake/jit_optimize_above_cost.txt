Based on the manual suggestion, it is recommended to adjust the 'jit_optimize_above_cost' knob which sets the query cost threshold, currently defaulting at 500000. This adjustment can lead to the application of expensive JIT compilation optimizations, which may increase planning time but improve execution speed. However, settings less than 'jit_above_cost' are considered meaningless and those more than 'jit_inline_above_cost' are likely unbeneficial. If you wish to disable these optimizations, you can do so by setting a specific value.
