The 'track_activity_query_size' knob in Postgres reserves memory to store the text of the current command for each active session, with the default value being 1024 bytes. This setting can only be adjusted at server start. If you are tracking query performance, you might consider increasing this value to log more of your query text. However, it's recommended not to set it too high to avoid potential issues.
