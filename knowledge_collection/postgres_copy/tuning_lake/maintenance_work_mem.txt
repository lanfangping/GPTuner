Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'maintenance_work_mem' knob in Postgres according to the size of your database and the available memory. This knob specifies the maximum memory used for maintenance operations such as VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY. Increasing its value can speed up these tasks, especially if you have large RAM resources and frequent write operations. However, it should not be set too high as it may allocate up to autovacuum_max_workers times this memory when autovacuum runs. It defaults to a certain value and can be set larger than work_mem for improved performance.
