To effectively manage your Postgres server, you should adjust the 'max_replication_slots' setting, which specifies the maximum number of replication slots the server can support. This setting can only be adjusted at server start and has a default value of 10. If set lower than the current number of replication slots, the server will not start. Additionally, 'wal_level' must be set to replica or higher for replication slots to be used. Consider the number of standby servers you have when setting this value, as each standby server requires one replication slot. For example, if you have 5 standby servers, set 'max_replication_slots' to at least 5.
