The 'min_parallel_table_scan_size' knob in Postgres sets the minimum amount of table data to be scanned for a parallel scan to be considered. This value is typically set at 8 megabytes (8MB), and if specified without units, it is taken as blocks, with each block being BLCKSZ bytes, usually 8kB. This knob should be set based on the size of your tables, as parallel scans will only be used for tables larger than this size. Adjusting this value will influence the number of tables that are scanned in parallel.
