Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'logical_decoding_work_mem' knob in Postgres. This knob controls the maximum memory, defaulting to 64MB, used by logical decoding before some decoded changes are written to local disk. This helps limit the memory used by logical streaming replication connections. If your system has sufficient memory, you can set this value higher than the default to reduce the amount of decoded changes written to disk, potentially improving the performance of logical decoding.
