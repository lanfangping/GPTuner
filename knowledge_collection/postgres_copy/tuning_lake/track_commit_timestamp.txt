Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'track_commit_timestamp' knob in PostgreSQL to record the commit time of transactions. This can be done by modifying the postgresql.conf file or using the server command line. By default, this feature is turned off. Please note that the value can be either 'on' or 'off', with 'on' enabling tracking of commit timestamps and 'off' disabling it.
