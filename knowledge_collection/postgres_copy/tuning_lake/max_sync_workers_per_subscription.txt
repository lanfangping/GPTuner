Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'max_sync_workers_per_subscription' knob in Postgres, which controls the maximum number of synchronization workers per subscription. This knob is used for parallelism during the initial data copy in subscription initialization or when new tables are added. It can be set based on the workload and system capacity, with a default value of 2. However, it should not exceed the maximum number of background workers configured for the entire system. Please note that there is a current limit of one worker per table.
