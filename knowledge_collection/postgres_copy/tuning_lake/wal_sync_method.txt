The 'wal_sync_method' knob in Postgres is utilized to determine the method for forcing WAL updates to disk. The possible values include open_datasync, fdatasync, fsync, fsync_writethrough, and open_sync. The default value is the first method supported by the platform or fdatasync on Linux. However, this may need to be adjusted for optimal performance or crash-safe configuration. The specific value should be set based on your system's capabilities and requirements, as improper settings can impact database reliability.
