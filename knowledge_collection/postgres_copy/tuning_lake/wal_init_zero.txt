Based on the manual suggestion, it is recommended that you consider the nature of your file system before enabling the 'wal_init_zero' knob. This feature pre-allocates space by filling new WAL files with zeroes. However, if you are using a Copy-On-Write (COW) file system, this may not be advantageous. In such cases, it would be more beneficial to disable the 'wal_init_zero' knob, allowing the system to write only the final byte when the file is created.
