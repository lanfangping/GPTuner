Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to adjust the 'log_rotation_size' knob in Postgres when the logging_collector is enabled. This knob sets the maximum size of an individual log file and a new log file will be created once this limit is reached. The adjustment can be made in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. The value should be set depending on the amount of log data your system generates, but it should not exceed the available disk space.
