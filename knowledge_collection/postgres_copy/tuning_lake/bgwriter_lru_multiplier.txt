Suggestion: The 'bgwriter_lru_multiplier' knob in PostgreSQL should be set based on your workload. This knob controls the number of dirty buffers written in each round, which is calculated by multiplying the average recent need by the value of 'bgwriter_lru_multiplier'. The default value is 2.0, allowing more buffers to be written by the background writer for heavy workloads. Please note that this setting can only be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.
