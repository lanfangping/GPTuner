Based on the manual suggestion, it is recommended to adjust the 'max_prepared_transactions' knob which determines the maximum number of transactions that can be simultaneously in the prepared state. By default, this feature is disabled with a setting of zero and can only be modified at server start. If you are using prepared transactions, ensure that this value is at least as large as max_connections. Additionally, on a standby server, this value must be set to the same or higher value than on the master server.
