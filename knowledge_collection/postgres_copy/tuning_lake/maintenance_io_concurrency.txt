For optimal performance, adjust the 'maintenance_io_concurrency' knob in Postgres, which is used for maintenance work across multiple client sessions. Its default value is 10 on supported systems or 0 otherwise. However, you can set it to match the number of drives in your system that can perform maintenance work in parallel. This value typically falls between 1 and 10, but you can also set it to 0 to disable I/O concurrency during maintenance operations. Furthermore, it can be specifically adjusted for tables in a particular tablespace.
