Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to set the 'max_connections' knob in postgres according to the number of concurrent connections your system needs, typically defaulted at 100. This limit must be set equal to or higher than the master server's value on a standby server, with adjustments only possible at server start. For most use cases, it is advisable to use connection pooling. When using connection pooling in transaction mode, set this parameter as a low multiple (2-5x) of the number of cores on the server. If running on session mode, set it to the minimum number of concurrent users that cannot be queued. If not using connection pooling, set it to the required number of concurrent users. Keep in mind that each additional connection consumes about 10MB of memory and performance may be suboptimal if not set correctly.
