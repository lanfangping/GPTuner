Suggestion: The 'bgwriter_lru_maxpages' knob in Postgres controls the maximum number of buffers that the background writer can clean/flush to disk per round. By default, this value is set to 100, but it can be adjusted depending on the workload. If you notice a high dirty buffer allocation, you may want to increase this value to enhance the activity of the background writer, especially on busy databases. However, if you wish to disable background writing, you can set this value to zero. Please note that this setting can only be adjusted in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line.
