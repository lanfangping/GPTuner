Based on the provided suggestions, it is recommended to set the 'max_wal_senders' knob slightly higher than the maximum number of expected clients. This is to allow for immediate reconnection in case of abrupt disconnection. This parameter, which specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections from standby servers or streaming base backup clients, defaults to 10 and can only be set at server start. It also requires 'wal_level' to be set to replica or higher.
