Suggestion: The 'bgwriter_delay' in Postgres specifies the delay between activity rounds for the background writer, which writes for a number of dirty buffers then sleeps for the length of 'bgwriter_delay'. This setting defaults to 200 milliseconds and can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. On busy systems, you may consider reducing 'bgwriter_delay' to increase background writer activity. Remember, values can be set in multiples of 10ms. Adjust this setting according to your system's needs.
