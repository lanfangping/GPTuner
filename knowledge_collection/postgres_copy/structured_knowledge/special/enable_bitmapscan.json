{"think_procedure": "The description of the knob 'enable_bitmapscan' indicates that it is used to enable or disable a feature, specifically the query planner's use of bitmap-scan plan types. This suggests that it is a binary knob, likely taking a value of 0 to disable the feature and 1 to enable it. However, there is no mention of any special values that would break the natural order of the knob, such as -1 or 0 performing a very different function compared to its regular operation. Therefore, it is not classified as a 'special' knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
