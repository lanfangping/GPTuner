{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob 'vacuum_cost_page_miss'. It is stated that this knob represents the estimated cost for vacuuming a buffer that has to be read from disk. This includes the effort to lock the buffer pool, lookup the shared hash table, read the desired block in from the disk and scan its content. The default value is 10. However, there is no mention of any special values such as -1 or 0 that would change the function of this knob or disable a feature. Therefore, this knob does not seem to be a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
