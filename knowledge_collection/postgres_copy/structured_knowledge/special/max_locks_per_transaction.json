{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'max_locks_per_transaction' is a numerical knob that controls the average number of object locks allocated for each transaction. It does not mention any special values that would change the function of the knob, such as disabling a feature. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob and does not have any special values that break the natural order. Hence, it is not a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
