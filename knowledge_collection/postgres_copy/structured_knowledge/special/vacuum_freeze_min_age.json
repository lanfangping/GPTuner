{"think_procedure": "First, we look at the description of the knob. The knob 'vacuum_freeze_min_age' specifies the cutoff age that VACUUM should use to decide whether to freeze row versions while scanning a table. The default value is 50 million transactions and users can set this value anywhere from zero to one billion. However, VACUUM will limit the effective value to half the value of autovacuum_freeze_max_age. This indicates that the knob has a special value that changes its behavior, which is a characteristic of a 'special' knob. Therefore, we can classify this knob as a 'special' knob. The special value in this case is any value greater than half the value of autovacuum_freeze_max_age, as VACUUM will limit the effective value to this.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
