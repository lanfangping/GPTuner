{"think_procedure": "First, we read the description of the knob. We see that the knob 'vacuum_cost_delay' is a numerical knob that controls the amount of time that the process will sleep when the cost limit has been exceeded. The description mentions that the default value is zero, which disables the cost-based vacuum delay feature. This indicates that the knob has a special value, zero, that changes its function significantly, breaking the natural order. Therefore, we can classify 'vacuum_cost_delay' as a special knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
