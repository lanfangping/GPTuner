{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'vacuum_defer_cleanup_age' specifies the number of transactions by which VACUUM and HOT updates will defer cleanup of dead row versions. The default value is zero, which means that dead row versions can be removed as soon as possible. This indicates that the knob has a special value of zero, which changes the behavior of the knob. Therefore, this knob can be classified as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
