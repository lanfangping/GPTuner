{"think_procedure": "The description of the knob 'wal_init_zero' indicates that it has two states, 'on' and 'off'. However, these states do not represent numerical values, but rather binary states. Therefore, it does not have a special numerical value that breaks the natural order. The knob's function changes based on whether it is set to 'on' or 'off', but this is a standard behavior for binary knobs, not a special behavior that breaks the natural order of numerical knobs.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
