{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'shared_buffers' is a setting that determines the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers. The description does not mention any special values that would change the function of the knob, such as disabling a feature. The knob has a minimum value of 128 kilobytes and can be set higher for better performance. The knob's value can be specified in different units, but there is no mention of a special value that would break the natural order of the knob. Therefore, I conclude that 'shared_buffers' is not a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
