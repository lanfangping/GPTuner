{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'vacuum_multixact_freeze_min_age' specifies the cutoff age that VACUUM should use to decide whether to replace multixact IDs with a newer transaction ID or multixact ID while scanning a table. The default is 5 million multixacts. Users can set this value anywhere from zero to one billion. However, VACUUM will limit the effective value to half the value of autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age. From this description, it is clear that there is no special value that changes the function of the knob drastically. Therefore, it is not a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
