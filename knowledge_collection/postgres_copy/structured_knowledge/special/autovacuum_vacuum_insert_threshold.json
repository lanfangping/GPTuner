Normally, this knob specifies the number of inserted tuples needed to trigger a VACUUM operation. However, when set to -1, it disables the autovacuum feature. This indicates that this knob is a 'special' numerical knob, as it has a special value that breaks its natural order and changes its function.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
