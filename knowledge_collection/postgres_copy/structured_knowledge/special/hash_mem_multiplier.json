{"think_procedure": "The description of the knob 'hash_mem_multiplier' does not mention any special values that would change the function of the knob drastically. It is used to compute the maximum amount of memory that hash-based operations can use, and the final limit is determined by multiplying work_mem by hash_mem_multiplier. The default value is 1.0, and increasing it may help in environments where spilling by query operations is a regular occurrence. However, there is no mention of a value that would disable a feature or change the function of the knob in a significant way.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
