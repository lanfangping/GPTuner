{"think_procedure": "The first step is to understand the description of the knob. The 'archive_mode' knob is related to the archiving of WAL segments. It has three settings: off, on, and always. The 'off' setting disables the feature, while 'on' and 'always' enable it with slight differences in functionality. The knob does not have a numerical value, but rather uses terms to denote its state. Therefore, it does not have a special numerical value that breaks the natural order. However, the 'off' setting does perform a different function by disabling the feature, which could be considered as a special value.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": "off"}
