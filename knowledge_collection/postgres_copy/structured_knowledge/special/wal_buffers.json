{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'wal_buffers' is a numerical knob that can be set to a specific value. The description mentions a default setting of -1, which performs a different function than its regular operation. When set to -1, it selects a size equal to 1/32nd of shared_buffers. This is different from its regular operation where it sets the amount of shared memory used for WAL data. Therefore, based on the description, 'wal_buffers' is a special knob with a special value of -1.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
