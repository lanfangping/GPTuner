{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'geqo_pool_size' controls the pool size used by GEQO, which is the number of individuals in the genetic population. It has a range of useful values from 100 to 1000. However, it also has a special value of zero, which is the default setting. When set to zero, the knob performs a different function, choosing a suitable value based on geqo_effort and the number of tables in the query. This breaks the natural order of the knob, making it a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
