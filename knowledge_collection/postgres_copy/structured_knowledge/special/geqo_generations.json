{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'geqo_generations' controls the number of generations used by GEQO, which is the number of iterations of the algorithm. It is mentioned that it must be at least one, and useful values are in the same range as the pool size. However, it is also mentioned that if it is set to zero (the default setting), then a suitable value is chosen based on geqo_pool_size. This indicates that the knob has a special value, which is zero, that changes its function. Therefore, it can be classified as a 'special knob'.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
