{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'vacuum_freeze_table_age' is a setting that determines when VACUUM performs an aggressive scan. The description mentions that users can set this value anywhere from zero to two billion, but VACUUM will limit the effective value to 95% of autovacuum_freeze_max_age. This suggests that there is a special value that changes the behavior of the knob. However, the description does not explicitly mention a special value such as -1 or 0 that would disable a feature or significantly change the knob's function. Therefore, I conclude that this is not a 'special' knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
