{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'max_pred_locks_per_page' controls how many rows on a single page can be predicate-locked before the lock is promoted to covering the whole page. The default is 2. This parameter can only be set in the postgresql.conf file or on the server command line. There is no mention of any special values that would change the function of this knob, such as disabling a feature. Therefore, this knob does not seem to be a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
