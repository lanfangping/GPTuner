{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. I noticed that it mentioned a specific value, -1, that changes the behavior of the knob. This value makes the knob use the regular vacuum_cost_limit value instead of its own. This is a different function compared to its regular operation, which is to specify the cost limit value for automatic VACUUM operations. Therefore, this knob can be classified as a 'special' knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
