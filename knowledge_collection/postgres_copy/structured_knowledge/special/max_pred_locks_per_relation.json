{"think_procedure": "First, we read the description of the knob. We see that the knob 'max_pred_locks_per_relation' controls how many pages or tuples of a single relation can be predicate-locked before the lock is promoted to covering the whole relation. We then look for any special values that this knob might have. We see that negative values have a special function, they mean max_pred_locks_per_transaction divided by the absolute value of this setting. This is different from the regular operation of the knob, which is to set an absolute limit when the value is greater than or equal to zero. Therefore, this knob is a 'special' knob and its special value is any negative number.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
