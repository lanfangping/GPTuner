{"think_procedure": "The description of the knob 'max_logical_replication_workers' does not mention any special values that would change the function of the knob. It only specifies that it determines the maximum number of logical replication workers, which are taken from the pool defined by max_worker_processes. The default value is 4, but there is no indication that setting it to a different value would change its function in a significant way. Therefore, it behaves like a regular numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
