The knob 'checkpoint_flush_after' is a numerical knob that controls the amount of data written during a checkpoint before forcing the OS to issue these writes to the underlying storage. The description mentions a valid range between 0 and 2MB. It also mentions that a value of 0 disables forced writeback, which is a different function compared to its regular operation. Therefore, this knob can be classified as a 'special knob' with a special value of 0.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
