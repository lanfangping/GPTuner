{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'jit_optimize_above_cost' is used to set the query cost above which JIT compilation applies expensive optimizations. It is mentioned that setting this knob to -1 disables expensive optimizations. This indicates that the knob has a special value that changes its function, which is a characteristic of a 'special' knob. Therefore, I classify this knob as a 'special' knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": -1}
