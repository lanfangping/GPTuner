{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'wal_writer_flush_after' specifies how often the WAL writer flushes WAL, in volume terms. It has a numerical value that determines the volume of WAL produced before it is flushed to disk. However, the description also mentions that if this knob is set to 0, then WAL data is always flushed immediately. This indicates that the knob has a special value, 0, that changes its function from determining the volume of WAL produced before a flush to causing immediate flushes. Therefore, this knob is a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": true, "special_value": 0}
