{"think_procedure": "The description of the knob 'random_page_cost' is analyzed. It is observed that the knob is a numerical knob that sets the planner's estimate of the cost of a non-sequentially-fetched disk page. The knob can be set to any value, and the system will let you set it to less than seq_page_cost, but it is not physically sensible to do so. However, there is no mention of any special values such as -1 or 0 that would perform a different function or disable a feature. Therefore, it is concluded that this is not a 'special' numerical knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
