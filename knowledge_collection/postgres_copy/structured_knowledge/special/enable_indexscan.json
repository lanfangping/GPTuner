{"think_procedure": "First, I read the description of the knob. The knob 'enable_indexscan' is described as enabling or disabling the query planner's use of index-scan plan types. This suggests that the knob has two states, on and off, which likely correspond to numerical values. However, the description does not specify any special values that would break the natural order of the knob, such as -1 or 0, that perform a very different function compared to its regular operation. Therefore, I would classify this knob as a regular numerical knob, not a special knob.", "special_knob": false, "special_value": null}
