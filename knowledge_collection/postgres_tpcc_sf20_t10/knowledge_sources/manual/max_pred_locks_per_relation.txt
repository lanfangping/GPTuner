The 'max_pred_locks_per_relation' knob controls the limit of pages or tuples of a single relation that can be predicate-locked before the lock is promoted to cover the whole relation, with values greater than or equal to zero indicating an absolute limit, and negative values indicating the division of max_pred_locks_per_transaction by the absolute value of this setting, with the default set at -2.
