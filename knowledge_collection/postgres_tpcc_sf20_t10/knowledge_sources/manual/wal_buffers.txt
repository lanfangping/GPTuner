The 'wal_buffers' knob refers to the shared memory used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data not yet written to disk, with a default setting of -1, equating to roughly 3% of shared_buffers, but not less than 64kB or more than 16MB, and can be manually set, with any value less than 32kB treated as 32kB, and is written to disk at every transaction commit, potentially improving write performance on busy servers.
