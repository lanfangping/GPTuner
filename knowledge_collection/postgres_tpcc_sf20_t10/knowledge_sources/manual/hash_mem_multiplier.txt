The 'hash_mem_multiplier' knob is used to calculate the maximum memory that hash-based operations can use by multiplying the 'work_mem' value by 'hash_mem_multiplier', with a default value of 1.0, and can be increased to between 1.5 to 2.0 for mixed workloads, or even 2.0 to 8.0 in environments where 'work_mem' is already over 40MB, especially if there are regular memory pressure issues.
